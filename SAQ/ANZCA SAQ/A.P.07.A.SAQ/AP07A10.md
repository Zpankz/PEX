EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a pass, an understanding of the balance between pro and anticoagulant processes that occur in the blood, and a brief outline of the mechanisms that prevent blood from clotting was required."
- "Candidates who followed the structure of Virchowâ€™s triad to elucidate these factors tended to score well by demonstrating understanding."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Many candidates would have benefited by providing a clear introductory statement, outlining the balance between pro and anticoagulant factors, and then explaining the factors that prevent coagulation."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "As general advice regarding examination technique, candidates may wish to consider that if confronted by a question that they may not have considered in preparation for the examination, by considering the basis of everyday clinical practice, they may yet be able to achieve a good score."
- "In this case, common clinical practices for prevention or perioperative deep venous thrombosis may have provided the key to an answer."
