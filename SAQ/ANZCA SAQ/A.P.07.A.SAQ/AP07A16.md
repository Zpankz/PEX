EC_expectedDomains:
- "A good answer would have included a definition of parenteral nutrition and a rationale for its use."
- "Normal daily requirements should have been described."
- "The components of parenteral nutrition include water and electrolytes, a common omission in many papers."
- "Most candidates covered well the caloric components of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins with a rationale for use."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Many answers also included the addition of vitamins, minerals and trace elements, which was pleasing, but the rationale of “to maintain normal levels” was insufficient to score marks."
- "Extra marks were awarded for discussing how the patients requirements alter in normal physiological circumstances, for example age, gender and pregnancy and in disease states such as sepsis and burns."
