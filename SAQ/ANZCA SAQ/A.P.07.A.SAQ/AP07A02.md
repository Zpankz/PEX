title: "After epidural injection in a healthy term pregnant woman, discuss the factors influencing the distribution of bupivacaine to (a) the maternal CSF and spinal cord; (b) the maternal circulation; (c) the foetus."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2007
sitting: A
question: 02
passRate: 46
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected for a pass included a discussion of the factors affecting diffusion as described in Fick's Law and how these pertained to the three diffusion interfaces outlined in the question."
- "Solubility, ionization, tissue and protein binding, amount of drug, and concentration gradient all affect the distribution of bupivacaine from the epidural space to the CSF and maternal systemic circulation, and subsequently to the foetus."
- "Demonstration of comprehension that there are physiological differences between these four compartments and how these determine bupivacaine's distribution was expected."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for the consequences of the addition of adrenaline or bicarbonate to the bupivacaine solution, a discussion on epidural depot of drug, the biphasic nature of systemic absorption and foetal acidosis effect on bupivacaine protein binding."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common errors included discussing elements of bupivacaine that were not requested; such as drawing its structure or a pharmacodynamic discussion of its toxicity."
- "Also, reproducing factual information, such as the pKa of the drug, without discussing how this affects its diffusion at the three interfaces, did not attract marks."
