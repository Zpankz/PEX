entityType: SAQ

college: ANZCA
year: 2007
sitting: A
question: 03
passRate: 69
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A structured approach was expected dividing the issues along pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic lines."
- "A patient factors approach or other structure was also acceptable."
- "The discussion was expected to relate the underlying factors to opioid analgesics."
- "Candidates were expected to outline that variability can be seen in areas of absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of these agents."
- "The discussion would also include the impact of factors such as age, pregnancy, coexisting medical disease or concurrent medication use."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Credit was given to candidates who outlined the potential impact of liver or renal disease with specific examples."
- "Discussion of genetic influences on enzymes and receptors was expected and was well covered by most candidates."
- "Discussion of tolerance, prior drug exposures and previous pain experiences in influencing individual responses attracted extra marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The question was specifically related to inter- individual variability and a simple discussion of mechanisms of action or side effect profiles for varying opioid agents scored no additional marks."
