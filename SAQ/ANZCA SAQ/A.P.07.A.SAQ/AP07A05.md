EC_expectedDomains:
- "The key to successfully dealing with this question was to address each of the three components: classification, mechanisms, and adverse effects."
- "The main points expected were a classification system that was coherent; for example: simple analgesics, anticonvulsants, antidepressant, membrane stabilizers and so on."
- "Proposed mechanisms of action should have included how the drugs work, and (importantly) why this reduces pain."
- "There are many drugs that can be used and there are many potential adverse effects."
- "For this component of the question, emphasis on the more specific drugs (e.g. anticonvulsants and antidepressants), and on specific (e.g. anti-cholinergic effects with antidepressants) rather that generic (e.g. rash, gastrointestinal upset) adverse effects, were rewarded."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "No marks were awarded for a definition of chronic pain, a description of the pathophysiology of chronic pain, or nonâ€“pharmacological therapies as these were not asked."
