EC_expectedDomains:
- "An adequate description of adverse effects was therefore expected for candidates to obtain a pass mark."
- "The main points should include a discussion on the accumulation of acetylcholine at muscarinic (at low dose) and nicotinic (at higher dose) receptor sites after administration of neostigmine."
- "The muscarinic effects are severe and hence the co-administration of antimuscarinic agent is important."
- "The most worrying adverse effects are bradyarrhythmia with hypotension."
- "Bronchoconstriction, salivation, tracheobronchial hypersecretion, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and enhanced peristalsis (and potential damage on bowel anastomosis) should be mentioned."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for including potential drug interaction with suxamethonium and mivacurium."
- "Marks were also awarded for depolarizing block after excessive doses of neostigmine."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "No credit was given for description of neuromuscular monitoring."
- "This question examined the pharmacology of neostigmine, a drug that is being used in anaesthesia on a daily basis."
