title: "Discuss the suitability of ketamine as a total intravenous anaesthetic agent in comparison with propofol."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2007
sitting: A
question: 04
passRate: 25
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To reach a pass standard simple, relevant information on the pharmacokinetics and the neurological, cardiovascular and respiratory pharmacodynamics of both agents was sufficient."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Almost no candidates explained that ketamine is an effective, sole anaesthetic agent used widely in unsophisticated medical settings, nor the relevance of its particular pharmacodynamic properties in this situation."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates understanding of total intravenous anaesthesia was limited to the use of propofol with pharmacokinetic model driven infusion pumps."
- "Frequently the \"comparison\" aspect of the answer was not well organized."
- "Answers using parallel columns for each agent's features were generally more complete in their comparisons."
- "In contrast, poorly laid out answers were also more likely to focus predominantly on either kinetic or dynamic features, and to commonly have incomplete comparisons between the two drugs."
