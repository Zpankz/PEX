entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2007
sitting: A
question: 12
passRate: 17
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The purpose of this question is to show an understanding of basic physiological principles involved in peritoneal dialysis and not its clinical applications or indications."
- "The main points expected for a pass were: PD takes places across a membrane (peritoneum) by exchange between dialysate and the patient’s blood."
- "The main processes are: a) Osmosis - movement of solvent from low to high solute concentration b) Diffusion – movement of solute from region of high to low concentration c) Solvent drag Definitions of these processes were required."
- "The factors which influence these processes are:• movement of solvent• tonicity – definition, dialysate is hypertonic mainly due to it’s hight glucose concentration, osmolarity approx. 400 mmol/L (2[Na]+ 0.055 [Glucose]+ 0.36 [BUN] b) movement of solute• Fick’s law of diffusion• Donnan effect – due to effect of charged plasma proteins"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Other points which gained marks:• purpose of PD- i.e. achieve balance of fluids, electrolytes, acid-base and excretion of toxins wastes• osmosis is a relatively fast process compared to diffusion• glucose absorption can cause hyperglycaemia• lactate is provided for conversion to bicarbonate by the liver helping with acid/base balance• protein transfer into dialysate can result in loss"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates showed a lack of understanding of these basic processes."
- "Many candidates wasted time on detailed description of what happens to individual solutes at the expense of explaining the basis physiological principles of diffusion and giving an example e.g. K+"
