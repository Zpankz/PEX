title: "Discuss how the body handles a metabolic acidosis."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2007
sitting: A
question: 11
passRate: 57
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points to be covered were a definition of a metabolic acidosis, discussion of extracellular and intracellular buffering systems, respiratory compensation, the renal mechanisms to excrete non-volatile acids (titratable acidity, ammonium and ammonia), and resorption and regeneration of bicarbonate."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were awarded for the mechanism of respiratory compensation, explaining that respiratory compensation does not lead to acid excretion, description of buffering by long as well as short term mechanisms, specific details of ammonia and ammonium production and bicarbonate regeneration, understanding that H+ ions can not be excreted unbound, the amount of acid that can be excreted by different renal mechanisms, and aldosteroneâ€™s effect on H+ excretion."
