title: "Briefly outline the acute management of malignant hyperthermia (during a relaxant general anaesthetic). Describe the important aspects of dantrolene pharmacology relevant to treating malignant hyperthermia."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2007
sitting: A
question: 06
passRate: 54
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Equal marks were devoted to each half of the question."
- "Inclusion of the following points would have scored a good pass mark."
- "Management: life-threatening emergency, call for help and dantrolene, cease triggers (e.g. volatile agents), hyperventilate with oxygen, maintain anaesthesia with non-triggering agents, give dantrolene 2.5 mg/kg, repeat up to 10 mg/kg, active cooling to <38 degrees."
- "Pharmacology: skeletal muscle relaxant presented as orange powder containing dantolene 20 mg, mannitol 3g and sodium hydroxide to bring pH >9 with 60mls water. Difficult to mix. Metabolized by liver enzymes, eliminated in urine and bile with a half-life of about 10 hrs. Inhibits calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum. It can cause phlebitis, use of verapamil contraindicated."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates who did not achieve a pass mark wrote very little on dantrolene pharmacology."
- "Many candidates gave long, detailed accounts of the etiology and pathology of malignant hyperthermia but this was not asked in the question and attracted minimal bonus marks."
