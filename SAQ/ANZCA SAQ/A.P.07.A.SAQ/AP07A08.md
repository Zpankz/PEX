title: "List the classes of drugs used clinically to treat chronic left ventricular failure. Outline their mechanisms of action."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2007
sitting: A
question: 08
passRate: 65
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Only 32% of candidates complied with the first part of the question, to LIST the classes of drugs used."
- "In order to satisfy the requirements of this question, candidates need to relate facts about drugs to their mechanisms of action."
- "Many answers included a definition of heart failure then attempted to relate the benefits of classes to this, however since no mention was made of diastolic dysfunction, many responses were incomplete."
- "It was common for candidates to outline the effects of an agent but not describe the mechanisms of those effects or their consequences."
- "This information needs to be explicit."
- "Thus many failed to acknowledge the influence of renin and how its levels are affected by different agents (eg. beta blockers)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Credit was given for a description of digoxin and its benefits in atrial fibrillation and other after-load reducing agents including prazosin and hydralazine."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates gave the mechanism of action for the management of myocardial ischaemia for nitrates and beta blockers; while this is often relevant, it is not the prime therapeutic goal for these agents in heart failure."
- "Beta blockers are not used to achieve a decrease in cardiac output."
- "Pre- and after load were frequently confused with few candidates mentioning Starling curves."
- "Although this question related to chronic failure, many candidates discussed drugs typically used for acute systolic dysfunction."
