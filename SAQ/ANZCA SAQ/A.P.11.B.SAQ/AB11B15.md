title: "Outline the physiological changes that may explain why an otherwise well patient may have a reduced urinary output intraoperatively (77.6%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2011
sitting: B
question: 15
passRate: 77
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates who demonstrated a clear understanding of renal physiology appropriately mentioned the determinants of urinary output, renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and factors affecting it, as well as the Starling's forces acting across the glomerular capillaries."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Marks were awarded to candidates who recognised that surgery is a stressful \"condition\" which results in secretion of various stress hormones."
- "Extra marks were given to candidates who were able to explain in detail the actions of ADH and other hormones such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The commonest mistake was the assumption that a reduction in urinary output is ONLY a reflection of a reduction in blood pressure."
- "However, an extensive list of plausible causes of hypotension does not translate to an outline of physiological changes that result in reduced urinary output."
- "Humoral factors, in fact, play an important role in maintaining water and sodium homeostasis but some candidates failed to even mention the hormones in this setting."
- "In reality, physiological processes that serve to conserve water and sodium are already in place even prior to any noticable drop in blood pressure. This is because osmoreceptors in the anterior hypothalamus are very sensitive to the plasma osmolality and a change as little as 1% due to a fasting state will cause increased antidiuretic hormone secretion. This results in a concentrated urine with a low volume."
