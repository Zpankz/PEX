title: "Describe the effects of resonance and damping on an invasive arterial blood pressure tracing."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2011
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 42
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Basic material required to pass: • Description of the measurement system was useful only if related to the following discussion • Definition of resonance and damping • Explanation of their importance and their effect on the timely measurement of the components of the blood pressure (systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, mean pressure)"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Advanced material: • Quantification of the effects"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common errors/omissions/unnecessary inclusions: • Equations without definition of symbols Input frequency is not 0 – 40Hz! • Natural resonant frequency is a property of the measuring system • Details of transduction were not required • “directionless relationships”; in a connected universe, everything influences everything else. To be of use, a relationship should include a direction of the effect, and a qualitative/quantitative indicator of the importance/magnitude"
- "Organisational errors: • Planning in the margins or on the back of the cover is a waste of time (headings can be used in the answer) • Long lists of definitions before any factual content is a poor use of time (definitions should be embedded within the answer itself)"
