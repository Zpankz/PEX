title: "Compare and contrast the clinically significant cardiovascular and central nervous system effects of desflurane and sevoflurane."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2011
sitting: B
question: 1
passRate: 66
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Most correctly appreciated the changes in systemic vascular resistance (SVR), myocardial contractility and consequent changes blood pressure due to sevoflurane and desflurane."
- "Also changes in cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic rate and intracranial pressure were well understood."
EC_extraCredit:
- "More than half recognised the effect of myocardial preconditioning which was awarded marks due to a broad definition of the term 'clinically significant'."
- "Better answers correctly discussed differences without getting too bogged down as of course there is a remarkable similarity between the two agents."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "However a deeper level of understanding was not universal, a common error being that falls in SVR equates to a fall in cardiac output whereas this tends to be well maintained with these agents initially due to a preserved baroreceptor reflex."
- "Also a loss of cerebral autoregulation at higher MAC values was not universally acknowledged."
- "Only two candidates discussed the QT interval and none mentioned that impaired diastolic function is also a cause of a reduction in stroke volume."
