title: "Describe the terms train-of-four stimulation and double burst stimulation with respect to the peripheral nerve stimulator. Describe their advantages and disadvantages when used to evaluate non-depolarising neuromuscular blockade."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2011
sitting: B
question: 8
passRate: 67
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Train of Four is delivered by 4 identical supramaximal stimuli at about 20 – 50 milliamps, each of .1 sec duration, at 2Hz (2 per second); the sequence may be repeated every 10 – 20 seconds if used ‘continuously’."
- "A synopsis of the twitch height and receptor blockade along with a description of the ratios was well described."
- "Interpretation of depth of blockade based on TOF count/ratio was also well discussed"
- "Double Burst Stimulation described as 2 bursts of 3 tetanic stimulations (.2 msecs duration each) 20 msecs apart at 50 Hz bursts separated by 750 msecs pause."
- "The repeatability takes into account the ‘fatigue’ of the junctions following tetanic stimuli."
- "Discussion of advantaged vs. disadvantages including such topics such as ease of use, accuracy to manual / visual assessment, need for extra objective measurement with eg accelomyography, painful or not, able for awake patients, painful or not, use for depth of block, use for assessing presence of residual blockade, use in reversibility of blockade, need or value of a baseline measurement form a choice of headings to make a comment on."
- "Most candidates were able to mention a few to demonstrate the physical/pharmacological/clinical rationale for the choice of technique used."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Confusion about millivolts and milliamps often cropped up."
- "Detailed descriptions of where and how to place electrodes, comparison of depolarising and non-depolarising blocks were not part of the question."
