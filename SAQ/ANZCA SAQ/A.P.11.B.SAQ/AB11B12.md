title: "Outline the similarities and differences between myoglobin and adult haemoglobin, explaining the physiological relevance of the differences."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2011
sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 24
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A brief description of the structure and location of these proteins, their respective dissociation curves and P50â€™s with a simple overview of the function of each of these proteins would round out a good answer."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Some candidates used a tabular format, others an essay format to answer this question. Both were equally effective strategies."
- "An answer offering more detail about the environments these proteins function in was awarded with further marks."
- "Additional credit was given for answers that explored the buffering and nephrotoxicity of these proteins."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The most common reason for not passing this question was simply because not enough relevant content was included."
- "Many candidates spent a lot of time describing in detail the process of buffering and the process of oxygen binding. This detail was not asked for and only received a few marks."
- "The P50 given for myoglobin was frequently incorrect and many answers indicated that myoglobin WAS NOT a haeme containing protein."
- "There was also a misconception in the minds of many that both haemoglobin and myoglobin bound four oxygen molecules."
- "No answer mentioned that myoglobin is located in cardiac muscle in addition to skeletal muscle."
