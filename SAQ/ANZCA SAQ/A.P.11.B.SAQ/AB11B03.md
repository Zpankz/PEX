title: "What is the mechanism of action of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists? Outline the therapeutic uses and side effects of these drugs."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2011
sitting: B
question: 3
passRate: 78
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Generally this was a very well answered question and most candidates covered all that was asked of them."
- "There was usually sufficient detail on the various cardiovascular uses of the drug, and many candidates added other uses of beta blockers such as treatment of glaucoma and migraine prophylaxis."
- "With regard to the mode of action, obviously they act by blockade of the beta receptor, but extra points were gained by pointing out that this is a form of competitive antagonism and that this group of drugs have very selective action on the beta receptors alone."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "There were some minor areas of confusion."
- "While beta adrenergic antagonists can be used to suppress the physical stigmata of anxiety, such as dry mouth and tremor, they have no significant anxiolytic properties per se – the patient (or candidate!) is just as anxious on the inside."
- "In fact most of the CNS effects of these drugs are quite deleterious and include, insomnia and sleep disturbance as well as vivid dreams."
- "Lastly confusion also reigned with regard to the effects of these drugs on the uterus, with candidates claiming that beta blocking drugs possessed both oxytocic and tocolytic effects."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The effects on the peripheral circulation are complex."
- "Older, non selective agents cause peripheral vasoconstriction (not dilatation) and can worsen or precipitate Raynaud’s disease, because the blockade of peripheral beta 2 receptors allows the vasoconstricting alpha effects to predominate unchecked."
- "However, newer agents that are used in the management of cardiac failure, often possess vasodilating properties, possibly mediated through nitric oxide release."
