title: "Describe the formation, fate and role of lactate in energy production."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2011
sitting: B
question: 16
passRate: 45
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A good answer followed the headings of the question thereby obtaining max marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates spent a lot of their answer on describing the citric acid cycle and aerobic metabolism, which gained no marks."
- "There was some confusion where the ATP is produced during anaerobic metabolism, ie; during glycolysis not on the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, and the enzyme for this is lactate dehydrogenase."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Lactate is produced daily by red blood cells and during strenuous exercise where a patient is not hypoxic."
- "It supplies a rapid energy source when oxygen demand is not met by supply but is not sustainable over a prolonged period."
- "It can be reutilised by the cells it is formed in(when pyruvate is able to enter the citric acid cycle the equilibrium shifts to allow lactate -> pyruvate) when oxygen is resupplied or can diffuse out of cells into the plasma for transfer to the 1.liver, to under go gluconeogensis(from pryuvate), this glucose can a)enter into the ATP inefficient cori cycle for further energy production during anaerobic conditions in the muscle, b) be stored as glycogen and c)enter the citric acid cycle, and 2.heart as an energy substrate."
- "Concepts such as the Law of mass action and including recycling of the substrates for biochemical equations (particularly NAD+) were appreciated."
