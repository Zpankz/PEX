title: "Describe the changes in respiratory function tests that occur with long term increases in small airways resistance."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2011
sitting: B
question: 14
passRate: 12
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question required an answer that was focused on the respiratory function tests that help assess the effects of chronic increased airway resistance."
- "Changes in the following tests needed to be discussed: • Forced expiratory volumes • Flow volume loops • Pressure volume loops"
- "Appropriate diagrams and graphs were expected with a description of the changes that happen when airway resistance is raised."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates also gained marks for discussing simple peak flow meter testing, simple spirometry changes, and closing volume changes."
- "Arterial blood gas changes and reduced oxygen uptake on exercise testing all gained additional marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Simply listing some respiratory changes but not relating the changes to a test was not sufficient to score marks."
- "Details on factors that determine resistance and flow was not part of the answer and in depth descriptions on how to perform a test was not required."
- "Some candidates confused obstructive lung disease with restrictive lung disease."
- "Care needs to be taken when drawing and labelling graphs so that they are accurate."
