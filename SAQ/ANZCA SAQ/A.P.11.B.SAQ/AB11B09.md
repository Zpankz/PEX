EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates who scored well wrote legibly, had a well-laid out/ presented answer and used a system-based approach"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This question was answered very poorly, which was surprising as it a recycled question that has been asked relatively recently"
- "Many candidates scored poorly by answering it as a Pharmacology question – The insertion of prostaglandin pessaries and the use of intravenous prostaglandins for neonatal Duct closure have no place in a Physiology answer…"
- "Other common errors were a very “narrow” answer – particularly focusing on one system (commonly renal)"
