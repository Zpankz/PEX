EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were required to describe the mechanism of a basic cationic binding protein combining with an acidic anionic compound to form a stable salt complex including some indication of relative doses required and the time course of the drugs actions."
- "Side effects which required outlining were not only that it causes allergy but the types of allergy caused and the side effects that would be observed because of it."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Higher marks were awarded for explanations of why excessive doses may cause hypocoagulability and the inconsistent reversal of Xa activity."
- "Similarly hypotension either due to rapid infusion or IgE mediated effects, the problems of thromboxane mediated pulmonary oedema and pulmonary vasoconstriction and the phenomenon of heparin rebound attracted higher marks."
