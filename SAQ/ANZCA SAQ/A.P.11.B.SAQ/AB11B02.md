title: "What is meant by the term \"two compartment model\" in pharmokinetics? Use PROPOFOL as an example in explanation."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2011
sitting: B
question: 2
passRate: 12
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A systematic approach is needed to answer such a broad question."
- "Areas which could be addressed include: • What the model attempts to do, the structure of this kind of model and the mathematics of the model. • Properties of propofol which suggest it might fit a multi, rather than a one compartment model. • A description of the model, implications of the model, what such a model might be used for and how this model differs from other pharmacokinetic models. • Assumptions implicit in using this model, and how this might affect its clinical application. • Sources of error in collecting data to test the model."
- "It was not necessary to cover all of these areas to obtain full marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates wasted time writing random pharmacokinetic data, details on the structure and use of propofol, definitions of pharmacokinetics, or frameworks for pharmacokinetic answers such as absorption, distribution, metabolism & excretion."
- "Commonly misunderstood concepts included: • Compartments being a theoretical construct only. • Models fit a curve to observed plasma concentrations plotted against time. • No-one described how such a curve might be fitted. • The y axis of the plasma concentration time curve is not half life. • The words “saturated”, “equilibrium”, “steady state”, and “context sensitive half time”."
EC_extraCredit:
- "It is difficult to explain the offset of propofol if the effect site is considered to be in the peripheral compartment."
- "Calculating a loading dose of propfol using the Vdss would be fatal."
- "A two compartment model is conventionally drawn with two, rather than three or four compartments."
- "Diagrams often depicted excretion as being bi-directional, or occurring through the brain. Both practices are discouraged."
