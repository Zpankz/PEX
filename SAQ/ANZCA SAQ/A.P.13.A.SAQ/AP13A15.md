title: "Explain how oxygen supply of organs is maintained during isovolaemic haemodilution."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2013
sitting: A
question: 15
passRate: 33
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A good answer included normal values for haemoglobin and oxygen content for arterial and venous blood, with a discussion on oxygen flux, the flux equation, the reserve of most tissues with low extraction ratios and demonstrated those that had a high extraction ratio had less tolerance for anaemia, e.g. the heart in exercise."
- "The answer required an explanation of viscosity of blood and flow dynamics through blood vessels recognizing that decreased viscosity decreased resistance and encouraged flow through vessels and back to the heart, increasing venous return will increase cardiac output to aid oxygen flux."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good answers included local autoregulation responses (vasodilation, shift of oxygen dissociation curve to encourage offloading of oxygen) and systemic responses, activation of the sympathetic nervous system at critical levels of anaemia."
- "Only one or two candidates mentioned some form of time frame for responses."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The question specifically stated isovolaemia so that no points were scored for explanations of responses to hypovolaemic shock."
- "A discussion of predilution of blood for surgery was not required in this question, and similarly scored no marks."
