title: "Describe the term s train-of-four stimulation and double burst stimulation with respect to the peripheral nerve stimulator. Describe their advantages and disadvantages when used to evaluate nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2008
sitting: A
question: 7
passRate: 16
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to provide a clear description of how train-of-four (TO F) and double burst stimulation (DBS) is produced using a peripheral nerve stimulator to evaluate non-depolarising neuromuscular blockade (NMB)."
- "A good understanding of the relationship between twitch height, TO F ratio and level of NDM B in the context of reversibility and block depth is imperative."
- "A description of the advantages, limitations and drawbacks of using both techniques was expected to achieve a pass mark."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good candidates were able to describe TOF correlates with receptor occupancy and provide comparison with single twitch and post tetanic count."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Whilst many candidates were able to outline the principles of TO F and DBS, most failed to provide precise or correct description of important technical aspects like frequency, timing and voltage."
- "The description of advantages and limitations were vague, patchy and fragmented and showed general lack of understanding of neuromuscular monitoring and its applied pharmacology."
