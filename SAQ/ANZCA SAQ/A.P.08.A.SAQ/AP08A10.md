title: "Define “thermoneutral zone”. Briefly explain how the body regulates temperature when the ambient temperature exceeds the thermoneutral zone."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2008
sitting: A
question: 10
passRate: 50
EC_expectedDomains:
- "An explanation of how temperature is regulated when the ambient temperature exceeds the thermoneutral zone should include the following: • PATHWAYS Sensors, afferent pathways and integration were generally well described but many candidates failed to mention that cutaneous vasodilatation was mediated by inhibition of sympathetic adrenergic tone and sweating was mediated by sympathetic cholinergic activation. • BEH AVIO U RAL RESPONSES • CUTANEOUS VASODILATATION Main points expected w ere, transfer of heat from core to skin, the role of arterio-venous shunts and deep venous plexuses and increases in skin blood flow up to 30 fold. • SWEATING Main points expected were that evaporation of water, does not require a temperature gradient, is very efficient at heat transfer due to the high latent heat of evaporation and is the only means available to transfer heat when ambient temperature exceeds skin temperature."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers demonstrated the linear increase in metabolic rate above and below the thermoneutral zone in graph form."
- "Better answers explained how heat transfer from the skin by conduction, radiation and convection required a temperature gradient."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates were able to define 'thermoneutral zone' and many were able to give normal values for adults and neonates."
