title: "Describe the physiological changes that occur in respiratory function during pregnancy."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2008
sitting: A
question: 12
passRate: 54
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Main Points expected for a pass: • A brief mention of reasons for the changes - hormonal, mechanical and increases in metabolic demand • Changes in lung volume and capacities • Alterations in ventilation – what causes the increase, how it is mediated and what are the effects (eg. fully compensated respiratory alkalosis) • Increased metabolic demand – the magnitude of the increase and how the body adapts to meet the demand • Anatomical changes • Some mention of the extra stress on the respiratory system resulting from labour"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional points could be gained for: • Clinical significance of the changes • Changes in the hypoxic ventilatory response curve and CO2 ventilatory response curve • Blood gases in pregnancy • Mention of changes in extraction ratio • Discussion of work of breathing in pregnancy • Dead space changes in pregnancy • Changes to the haemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve • Dyspnoea of pregnancy"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common problems: • Illegible handwriting • Lack of structure when answering the question• Changes in airway resistance were poorly understood with wide variation in answers • Few candidates mentioned the changes that occur during labour • The role of relaxin in mediating changes in the respiratory system was often overstated • Inaccurate terms were common such as ‘total lung volume’, ‘functional residual volume’ • The main reason for failing this question was a failure to demonstrate factual knowledge."
