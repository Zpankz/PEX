title: "Describe the ideal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of agents used for sedation. Outline the pharmacology of midazolam and propofol with reference to these ideal properties."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2008
sitting: A
question: 3
passRate: 66
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected for a pass included a description of the ideal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features of an agent specifically suited to the clinical situation of providing sedation."
- "Therefore, pharmacokinetic features that result in a rapid onset and offset of effect with boluses or infusion is ideal."
- "Also the effects of anxiolysis, amnesia and arousable sedation were considered desirable, with low propensity to inadvertently progress to general anaesthesia."
- "An outline of how midazolam and propofol fitted this ideal agentâ€™s features was also required."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A discussion about other ideal features such as analgesia and stable cardio-respiratory effects of the sedation agents were also expected."
- "Extra marks w ere aw arded for an opinion comparing the suitability of midazolam and propofol suitability for the provision of sedation, based upon the profiles generated above."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A common error was to include pharmaceutic information that was not required, and factual pharmacokinetic information about each drug was given little credit when not applied to how it affected the agent's profile with reference to the ideal agent."
