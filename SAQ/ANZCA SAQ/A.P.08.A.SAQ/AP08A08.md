title: "Define the mechanisms of action and adverse effects of metoprolol, glyceryl trinitrate and diltiazem when used to manage myocardial ischaemia."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2008
sitting: A
question: 8
passRate: 65
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected candidates would discuss the general concept of a balance of supply and demand and go on to describe the main determinants of oxygen demand being heart rate and contractility."
- "It was expected that the mechanism of action for each agent would be outlined."
- "Some discussion of both the general clinical effect and more detailed mechanism of action were expected."
- "For example, metoprolol is a selective beta 1 receptor antagonist that results in decreased cyclic AM P as a second messenger."
- "The resultant clinical effects are primarily a reduced heart rate and reduced contractility."
- "It was expected that the potential adverse effects for each agent would be mentioned."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were given for discussing the role of ventricular dilation."
- "For agents that slow the heart rate extra credit was given for an explanation about the proportion of the cardiac cycle spent in diastole at high and low heart rates and the impact this has on coronary blood flow and myocardial perfusion."
- "Extra marks w ere aw arded for reiterating why this is beneficial for patients with myocardial ischaemia."
- "Extra credit was given for comments regarding the development of tolerance to glyceryl trinitrate."
- "Additional marks were gained for discussing the potential adverse impact that inducing tachycardia or hypotension can have on myocardial ischaemia."
- "Further credit was given for noting that both the clinical effects and the potential for adverse effects are synergistic with each of these and other agents."
