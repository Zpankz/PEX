title: "Describe how the kidney establishes the medullary concentrating gradient."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2008
sitting: A
question: 15
passRate: 71
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points that needed to be addressed for a pass include: 1. the Loops of Henle w ith their water permeable descending part and water impermeable ascending part which actively removes solute from the tubule lumen – the countercurrent multiplier system 2. the vasa recta which are parallel to the Loops of Henle and permeable to water and solute with low flow , w hich allow s the gradient to be maintained – the countercurrent exchange mechanism 3. the role of urea which is concentrated in the medulla by mechanisms which involve changes in permeability to urea in different regions of the tubules partly influenced by the effects of antidiuretic hormone."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Areas which created problems for a number of candidates included (1) the fact that the medullary gradient refers to a gradient down the medulla in the interstitial fluid rather than between the tubules and the interstitium (2) The correct use and relevance of the terms “countercurrent exchange” and “counter current multiplier” (3) The role of urea (which is described with some differences in detail in the texts) was often overlooked (4) the details of which sections of the Loop of Henle w ere water permeable and w hich were not and where active solute resorption occurred."
