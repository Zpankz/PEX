title: "The skin, the kidneys, and the carotid bodies are examples of where specific organ blood flow is far in excess of that organâ€™s metabolic requirements. For each example, explain what the physiological role of the high organ blood flow is, why this high flow is an advantage to the person and a brief description of the mechanism s involved."
entityType: SAQ

sitting: A
question: 9
passRate: 11
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To answer this question, candidates had to explain the role of the high organ blood flow , the advantage of this high flow , and the mechanism creating the high flow for all three organs."
- "Skin: Thermoregulation role with heat conservation / loss. Normothermia allow s normal enzyme function. High flow via superficial arteriole network and arterio-venous anastomosis with sympathetic nervous system control."
- "Kidneys: Role is to excrete waste products and sodium / water balance. Advantage is the maintenance of constant internal environment. High flow via short large renal arteries, parallel interlobular arteries and parallel afferent arteriole branches."
- "Carotid bodies: High flow means organ oxygen requirements do not interfere with measuring PaO2 The advantage is early detection of hypoxia. High organ flow occurs due to the small size of the organ and flow directly from the carotid artery."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks for role as a blood reservoir, correct value of blood flow , and importance of sweating."
- "Additional marks for renal blood flow value."
- "Additional marks for organ blood flow rate and lack of effect from anaemia or carbon monoxide poisoning."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A common mistake was to describe in detail how blood flow is controlled or altered, especially when referring to the kidney and this was not asked for."
- "Descriptions of physiological pathways and their end organ responses were also not asked for."
- "Re-w riting the question was not helpful."
- "Carotid bodies were often incorrectly described as having a baroreceptor function."
