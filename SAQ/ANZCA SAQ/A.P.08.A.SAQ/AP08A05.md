title: "Classify drugs that alter activity at serotonin receptors with examples. Describe their mechanisms of action and clinical indications."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2008
sitting: A
question: 5
passRate: 39
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points that needed to be made to demonstrate an understanding of this topic were an overview that receptor activity can be altered by drugs that are agonists (e.g. metoclopramide, sumatriptan), antagonists (e.g. ergotamine, ondansetron) and drugs that increase the amount of serotonin and in turn increase activity at the receptor by increasing release (tramadol), inhibiting reuptake (fluoxetine) or inhibiting breakdown of serotonin."
- "All of the serotonin receptors are G - protein linked except 5HT-3 w hich is ligand gated."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The term “indirect agonist” is the best description."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many answers gave extensive detail of the vomiting pathw ays w hich was of limited relevance."
- "There was confusion over the classification of serotonin reuptake inhibitors."
- "They were often described as agonists (this implies a direct receptor action); others described the same drugs as antagonists because they inhibit re-uptake."
- "Most candidates focused only on the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI) and the 5HT-3 antagonists."
- "The mechanism of action was often described as a tautology (i.e. SRI’s inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and 5HT-3 antagonists antagonize the 5H T-3 receptor)."
- "These explanations failed to attract additional marks making a pass impossible to achieve."
