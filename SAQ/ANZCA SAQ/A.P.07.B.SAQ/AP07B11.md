title: "Explain the physical principles of ultrasound imaging."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2007
sitting: B
question: 11
passRate: 60
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Main points expected: Definition of ultrasound and range of frequencies."
- "Principle of ultrasound genesis, tissue passage and reception (piezoelectric crystal understanding)"
- "Mention of acoustic impedance (density and sound velocity), reflection (intensity related to degree of differences in tissue density, latency related to depth)."
- "Appreciation of relationship between velocity, frequency and wavelength."
- "Ability to correctly describe relationship of wavelength (or frequency) regarding penetration versus resolution."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks: for mention of Doppler mode and correct description of Doppler effect."
- "Doppler equation was awarded points where the values were correctly explained."
- "Ability to calculate cardiac output was only credited when the principle behind the calculation using Doppler and M Mode to calculate area of aortic valve was explained."
- "Understanding that 2D pictures require an array of crystals"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Incorrect formulas"
- "Simple statements such as Doppler can be used to measure flow followed by the equation which is solving for velocity scored no marks."
- "Many candidates spent wasted time listing advantages and disadvantages (not asked for and not worth any marks)."
- "Others spent too much time drawing sine waves with amplitude, wavelength and frequency and not enough time discussing the relationship between these."
- "Incorrect statements such as Doppler is used to measure flow followed by the equation which is solving for velocity."
