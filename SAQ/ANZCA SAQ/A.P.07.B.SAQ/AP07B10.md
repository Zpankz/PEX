title: "Briefly describe the factors that affect the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in mixed venous blood."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2007
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 38
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Good answers demonstrated an understanding of this and provided details about these aspects"
- "The partial pressure is related to the content by the carbon dioxide dissociation curve the position of which is determined by the state of oxygenation of haemoglobin, the Haldane effect."
- "Carbon dioxide is present in the blood in three forms, dissolved, bicarbonate and carbamino compounds."
- "Carbon dioxide production is related to aerobic metabolism in cells and the total production is defined by the metabolic rate."
- "The partial pressure of carbon dioxide in mixed venous blood is related to the pressure or content in arterial blood."
- "This is determined by alveolar ventilation and normally controlled by chemoreceptor and the brainstem respiratory centre."
- "Other relevant material included definitions of mixed venous blood, normal values, the effect of temperature and cardiac output."
EC_extraCredit:
- ""
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The most common error was discussing PCO2 without making it clear whether it was venous or arterial."
- "The Fick equation was often used but required “solving” for CvCO2 to demonstrate the factors or importance to this question."
