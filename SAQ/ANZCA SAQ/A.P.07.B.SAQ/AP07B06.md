title: "Describe how suxamethonium produces neuromuscular blockade. What is the mechanism of recovery of neuromuscular function and what mechanisms may be involved in Phase II block?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2007
sitting: B
question: 6
passRate: 75
EC_expectedDomains:
- "In order to gain maximum marks it was important that candidates specifically answered the three parts of the question i.e. mode of action, mechanism of termination of effect and the mechanism of Phase II block."
- "Most candidates explained the salient features of the ion channel comprising the Ach receptor at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and the role of the alpha sub-units."
EC_extraCredit:
- "With regard to the mechanism of Phase II block it is acknowledged that this canâ€™t be stated with certainty. However, the recommended texts suggest at least four mechanisms that could be involved and points were awarded for mentioning any of these."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "There was some confusion as to why the post-junctional membrane remained resistant to further depolarization by Ach"
- "With regard to termination of action the main error was to suggest metabolism of suxamethonium by pseudocholinesterase at the NMJ."
- "Unfortunately many candidates spent a great deal of time writing about how a Phase II block can be produced clinically and the means by which it can be identified using the nerve stimulator."
