title: "Draw and label a lead II electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing for one cardiac cycle, indicating normal values. What is the PR interval and what factors influence it?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2007
sitting: B
question: 16
passRate: 50
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The answer to this question should include: 1) A diagram of a typical lead 2 ECG trace, with axes, and labels on P, QRS, and T waves, PR and QT intervals, and ST segments. 2) Quantification of the normal values of duration of PR, QRS and QT interval. 3) Definition and explanation of the significance of the PR interval – in particular the importance of the AV node. 4) A list of factors that increased or decreased the PR interval – autonomic system, cardiac abnormalities/disease (WPW, ischaemia), drugs, other physiological derangements (hypothermia, hypokalemia)"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were given for detailed description of cellular mechanisms of changes in the PR interval and an outline of the allowable normal deviation from isoelectric values of the ST segment, and size of the Q wave."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Inability to quantify the time intervals."
- "Confusion of milliseconds with seconds was very common."
- "The PR interval was not accurately described – it is from the start of the P wave to the start of the QRS complex (which is usually the Q wave, not the R wave)."
