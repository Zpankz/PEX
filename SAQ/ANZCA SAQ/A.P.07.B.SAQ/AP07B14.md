title: "Describe the cardiovascular changes in the neonate that occur at birth."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2007
sitting: B
question: 14
passRate: 35
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question asked for a description of changes; this potentially allows inclusion of a functional description, mechanism of change (where known), time course and consequences."
- "Points to include: A discussion of the changes as above."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers: Indicated the above and showed the relevance of the changes. Included comments about the transitional nature of some changes"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Discussion of changes at birth does not include the gradual replacement of HbF with HbA."
- "Diagrams were often of poor quality, and thus unhelpful."
- "Information in diagrams was often repeated longhand in written form (gaining no extra marks)."
- "Ten minute questions probably don't require planning notes in the margin, nor should summaries be included, as repetition will not gain extra marks."
- "Terminology was often loose and the sequence of changes and mechanisms was poorly described."
- "Confusion in the use of the terms; flow, pressure, resistance and volume was common."
- "The placenta is NOT the reason that the foetal circulation is described as parallel."
- "The pulmonary circulation initially has high resistance."
- "The high negative pressure at inspiration is NOT the direct cause of the fall in PVR."
- "The ductus arteriosus does not connect the right ventricle to the aorta, neither does the ductus venosus connect the IVC to the brain."
