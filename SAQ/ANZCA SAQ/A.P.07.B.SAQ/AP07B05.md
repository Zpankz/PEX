title: "Describe the factors which increase the risk of systemic toxicity with amide local anaesthetic agents."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2007
sitting: B
question: 5
passRate: 37
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The focus of this question was on CVS and CNS toxicity related to excessive serum plasma levels of drug."
- "Successful candidates structured their answers along pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors."
- "Concise descriptions of pharmacokinetic factors such as dosage limits, site of administration and rate of administration vs clearance were expected."
- "Succinct descriptions of why certain amides had greater risk of toxicity were expected, e.g. Na channel affinity, lipid solubility, duration of action, lack of vasoconstrictive properties."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were awarded for describing the role of isomers, specific drug interactions, and the role of various physiological factors (pregnancy, neonate, elderly) and pathological factors (tachycardia, electrolyte disturbances, hypoxia, hypercarbia)."
- "Marks were awarded for descriptions of a scale of toxicity vs. specific plasma levels and relating it to CVS:CNS toxicity ratios"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "There appeared to be confusion regarding how pH/pKa applied to toxicity."
- "At times, the role of plasma protein binding was not clearly explained."
- "The role of changes in volume of distribution was commonly omitted."
- "Commonly, there was confusion between amide and ester local anaesthetics."
- "General descriptions of local anaesthetics and their mode of action did not accrue any marks."
