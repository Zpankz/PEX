EC_expectedDomains:
- "A discussion of the two main groups and their side effects achieved a pass."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Many candidates outlined the mode of action and side effects of the meglitinindes and thiazolidinediones. They were rewarded for their knowledge."
- "Other points worth mentioning relate to the degree of protein binding with resultant displacement of other highly bound drugs e.g. warfarin and the potential for altered drug activity, some agents cross the placenta â€“ causing fetal hypoglycaemia and the theoretical potential for inhibition of ischaemic and pharmacological pre-conditioning with sulphonylureas."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The basis of lactic acidosis with biguanides needed some mention of the action of the drugs at mitochondrial membranes and the increased risk in renal, hepatic impairment and states of decreased perfusion."
