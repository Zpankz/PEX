title: "Briefly explain the cardiovascular responses to central neural blockade."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2007
sitting: B
question: 9
passRate: 42
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To achieve a pass, candidates were expected to describe the effects of sympathetic blockade on arterial and venous vessels, how these lead to a drop in cardiac output and blood pressure, and compensatory reflexes involving the various baroreceptors and atrial naturetic peptide."
- "Explanations should have included effects of potential α and ß blockade, and the fact that venodilation (venous side contain 75% of blood volume) and consequent decreased venous return is more significant than vasodilation."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were allocated for explaining: - Effects of sympathetic blockade at different levels e.g. Sacral blockade alone – little effect as parasympathetic fibres involved only; lumbar blockade vs high thoracic blockade “high” block affecting brainstem; - Mid-thoracic block and renal compensatory mechanism to increase blood flow via JG cells (and not an increase in sympathetic outflow from brainstem vasomotor centre as described by a number of candidates); - Possible contribution of Bezold-Jarisch reflex; - Afferent/efferent nerves and central control response of high and low pressure baroreceptors; - Consequences of age, hypovolaemia."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates failed to explain why hypotension is more pronounced with ascending block height, and/or effects seen with blockade of cardio- accelerator fibres (T1 – 4)."
- "Answers describing “vasodilation” were read as meaning arterial dilatation alone."
- "Detailed descriptions of drugs or techniques used to attain an epidural/spinal block did not attract marks."
