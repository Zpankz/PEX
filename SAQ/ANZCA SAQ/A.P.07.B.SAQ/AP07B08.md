EC_expectedDomains:
- "The core answer required a brief account of the two main classes of drugs (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) that block the effects of angiotensin, including their mechanism of action, clinical use, side effects and essential differences between the two classes of drugs."
EC_extraCredit:
- ""
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some candidates also gave detailed accounts of the physiology of the renin-angiotensin system without explaining how or where in the system these drugs work or what their effects are."
- "Vague statements such as, side effects include electrolyte disturbances, the drugs decrease BP without explaining how, that the drugs have differing half lives or the drugs cause ventricular remodelling without explaining when this is useful do not contribute much to answers."
- "The most frequent omission was any account of when these drugs are used clinically."
