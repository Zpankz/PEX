title: "A new test called the “intubation score” has a reported 90% sensitivity and 70% specificity when used to predict difficult intubation. Describe how this information and other statistics related to this test can be used in predicting difficult intubation. How will the incidence of difficult intubation affect the performance of this test?"

EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question asks candidates to apply knowledge of statistical analysis related to screening tests."
- "It guides the candidates to discuss “intubation score” in relation to reported sensitivity and specificity and asks how “disease incidence” effects test performance."
- "Answers that provided definitions of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values with reference to predicting difficult intubation and described the relationship between incidence and testing achieved a pass."
- "This was most easily achieved through reference to a contingency table, which highlighted possible outcomes of diagnostic testing."
- "Finally a definition of incidence and its influence on positive and negative predictive value was needed."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Clarification of each cell in the table attracted marks, for example the situation of positive prediction in the presence of difficult intubation being described as a true positive."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Errors that were evident included confused, incomplete answers and answers that did not make reference to the scenario of difficult intubation."
- "Some were answered incompletely or the question was misinterpreted."
