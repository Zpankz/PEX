title: "Outline the mechanisms by which the kidney maintains potassium homeostasis."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2007
sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 25
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Main points expected for a pass included an outline of how potassium is handled as the glomerular filtrate passes along the nephron and a brief appreciation of the mechanisms of secretion and reabsorption of potassium."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were allocated for more detail on the actual cellular mechanisms for secretion and the cellular processes that are influenced by aldosterone."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The most common reason for not passing this question was the lack of any structure and a paucity of relevant information."
- "Very few candidates appreciated that reabsorption of potassium is fixed and that altering potassium secretion is the regulatory process."
- "Credit was not given for elaborate discussions of the determinates of glomerular filtration or for detailed descriptions of the systemic control of aldosterone secretion."
