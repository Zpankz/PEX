title: "List the anaesthetic related uses of clonidine. What are the effects of clonidine on the cardiovascular and central nervous system and how are these effects mediated?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 3
passRate: 68
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A list of anaesthetic related uses includes premedication/anxiolysis, intraoperative haemodynamic stability, and augmentation/prolongation of regional neural blockade."
- "A clear statement about clonidine mechanism of action as a partial agonist at α receptors with a relative selectivity of α2:α1 of 200:1 was required."
- "Expected CVS effects included hypotension, bradycardia and peripheral vasodilation."
- "These are mediated via central α2 receptors which inhibit the vasomotor centre in brainstem . There are no direct effects on the heart, but there is reduction in circulating catecholamines."
- "The CNS effects of sedation and analgesia are mediated via central α2 receptors via inactivation of locus coeruleus and activation of descending inhibitory pain pathways."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Marks were also awarded for use in post-operative analgesia and postoperative shivering."
- "Extra marks were also provided in discussing its use in prevention of perioperative myocardial ischaemia."
- "M arks w ere aw arded for discussion about its anaesthetic sparing uses, but no marks w ere aw arded for stating it could be used as an anaesthetic alone."
- "Marks were also awarded for discussing initial peripheral vasoconstriction and transient hypertension via direct action on peripheral α2 receptors, extra marks for discussing the changes to the baroreceptor reflex, and bonus marks for mentioning the role of imidazoline receptors in brainstem ."
- "Further marks w ere aw arded for discussing the spinal mechanisms of analgesia via spinal α2 receptors in the dorsal horn which depress wide dynamic range neurons involved in peripheral nociceptive input."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Whilst a dry mouth is a common side effect of clonidine, it is not typically used as an antisialagogue for anaesthetic purposes."
- "Inform ation regarding clonidine pharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic profile was not required."
