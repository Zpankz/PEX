title: "Explain the concept of time constants and relate these to “fast” and “slow ” alveoli"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 13
passRate: 40
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The answer should include: 
• An objective (mathematically-based) definition of a time constant, 
• In relation to lung units, the time constant is often defined as the product of compliance and resistance. 
• Some factors that influence time constants (physiological and pathological causes of alterations in compliance and resistance) 
• The effects of heterogeneity in time constants (static vs. dynamic compliance and respiratory rate)"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for ways of measuring the effects of heterogeneity of time constants. The capnogram and the peak vs. plateau pressures."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates spent a lot of time explaining various other formulas pertaining to compliance, surfactant, and alveolar collapse that were not directly relevant to the question."
- "Many candidates thought that increased compliance causes fast time constants."
