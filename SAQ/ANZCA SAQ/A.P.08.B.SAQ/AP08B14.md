title: "Explain in physiologic terms the effect of severe aortic stenosis on myocardial supply and demand."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 14
passRate: 45
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This was an applied physiology question."
- "The first part of an answ er was a description of aortic stenosis, with additional marks for giving measures) of severity."
- "The main part of the answer concerned the interrelated effects of a severely stenosed aortic valve that may produce both increased myocardial work (described using Laplaceâ€™s law ) and com prom ised coronary blood flow ."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks w ere aw arded for answers that discussed the varying effects of left ventricular hypertrophy on both supply and demand."
- "Marks were also awarded for discussing how increased heart rate may both increase dem and and reduce supply."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Errors included: confusing the effects of altered pressure with altered flow ; failing to indicate that severe aortic stenosis is a chronic condition; and including, often at length, the effects of anaesthesia or the symptoms and signs of aortic stenosis."
