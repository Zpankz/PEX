EC_expectedDomains:
- "A definition of sleep, an indication of the components of sleep and their duration followed by a brief notation of the physiological changes occurring in the neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic system was rewarded with a good pass."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional detail, particularly in regard to the neurological changes, was rewarded with additional marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Sleep is a NECESSARY REVERSIBLE reduction in the conscious state from which one can be easily AROUSED by sensory or other stimuli."
- "The m ost com m on reason for not passing this question was a poor definition (or no definition at all) and simply not notating an adequate number of physiological changes."
- "The m ost com m on error was to correctly state that parasympathetic tone predominates during sleep only to then state that gut motility was reduced."
- "Q uite a few answers lacked any structure whatsoever."
- "Credit was not given for descriptions of physiological compensatory mechanisms, such as for reduced venous return or determinants of G FR."
