entityType: SAQ

sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 48
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A basic definition of sepsis was expected."
- "Given the wording of this question equal marks were given for the general (non-metabolic) and metabolic features of sepsis."
- "The general features were best organised by a system s approach namely cardiovascular, respiratory, hematologic, endocrine and CNS. Of these the cardiovascular features required the most detail."
- "Important information to be included in the metabolic part of the answ er included the general catabolic state, hypermetabolism , fever, tissue hypoxia, metabolic acidosis, insulin resistance and the effect of sepsis on the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Recognition of the spectrum of severity encompassed by the term sepsis gained additional marks, as did a brief description of the mechanism s and mediators of sepsis."
- "Clear writing and simple organisation involving underlined headings and common abbreviations allowed candidates to cover this broad question well."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Those who failed this question sim ply did not provide enough content and detail."
- "The m ost com m on mistake was to write at length about metabolic acidosis to the exclusion of a wider ranging answ er."
- "Detailed metabolic pathways were not expected."
