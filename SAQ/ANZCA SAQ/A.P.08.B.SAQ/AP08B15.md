title: "Describe the changes that occur with ageing that can affect oxygen delivery to the tissues during moderate exercise."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 15
passRate: 14
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Oxygen delivery is the product of cardiac output and arterial oxygen content."
- "Oxygen delivery during exercise is increased by raising cardiac output globally and locally, and increasing oxygen extraction."
- "Linking these changes to aging is the key to answering this question."
- "Cardiac output and respiratory changes with aging both needed discussion to gain a pass mark."
- "Key points: 
• Cardiac output - contractility↓, heart rate responsiveness↓, stroke volume↓, ventricular compliance↓, and cardiac work↑ with aging. These factors reduce the ability to increase cardiac output to match exercising tissue demand. 
• Respiratory – PaO↓, work of breathing↑ with a ↓ in chest w all compliance, closing capacity encroaches on FRC, and diffusion capacity↓ from ↑alveolar membrane thickness and ↓ functional surface area. The ↑V/Q mismatch that results reduces the ability to oxygenate blood when extraction increases."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks w ere awarded for mentioning blood flow ↓ with atherosclerosis, ↑pulmonary resistance and heart strain, anaemia ↓ O2 content, moderate exercise is below anaerobic threshold, and valvular defects can affect cardiac output."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common errors included focusing on either cardiac or respiratory changes; listing aging and exercise physiological changes without linking the important factors of the two together; describing anaerobic metabolism of tissues; stating that FRC reduces with increasing age; not differentiating between the ↓chest w all compliance and ↑lung compliance that happens with aging."
