entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 8
passRate: 79
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A clear explanation of a Randomised Controlled Trial was required e.g. “a trial in which patients are allocated by a form of randomisation between groups; and in which an intervention group is compared to a control group, that may be active or inactive”."
- "Thereafter a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of such trials was required."
- "Strengths were considered to be that RCT represents a high level of evidence and can be included in meta-analyses, m inim isation of bias, reduction of the effect of confounders by being evenly distributed between groups, ease of blinding, ease of applying inclusion/exclusion criteria and providing a good basis to apply statistical analysis."
- "Weaknesses were considered to be that they are more expensive, may not reflect real life situations, raise the possible ethical concern of recruiting patients to w hat m ay be considered a less effective technique, difficulty of meeting ethical requirements in obtaining informed consent from patients w ho may receive a less beneficial treatment."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Whilst blinding is often added to an RCT, a discussion of the advantages conferred with blinding was appropriate and attracted additional marks"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates appeared to confuse randomisation with blinding and wrote entirely on the advantages and disadvantages of blinding."
- "however candidates w ho wrote solely about blinding without acknow ledgem ent of w hat constitutes an RCT, received low marks."
- "Likewise the “controlled” part of an RCT applies to the use of a control against which to compare the intervention group and does not mean that there is a “high degree of control” of the study or that the researchers “tightly control all aspects of the trial”."
