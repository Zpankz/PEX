title: "Outline the potential beneficial and adverse effects of isoflurane on the cardiovascular system (include mechanisms of effect) in patients with ischaemic heart disease."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 1
passRate: 41
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To answer the question it was necessary to describe the effects of isoflurane on the cardiovascular system , explain how these might affect myocardial oxygen balance, and give some explanation as to how these effects might occur. As the question is not specific, all mechanism s from cellular to organ system interactions were accepted."
- "A pass would have included the fall in SVR and blood pressure, the compensatory rise in heart rate, a note on direct effects on contractility, and an explanation as to how these effects might alter the myocardial oxygen supply and demand."
- "A brief description of the concepts of coronary steal and ischaemic preconditioning, and something on their purported mechanism was also expected."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks w ere aw arded for candidates who could list purported mechanism s for isoflurane causing these effects, such as altered sympathetic outflow , or calcium channel antagonism , the alteration skeletal muscle vascular tone resulting in lowering of SVR, the effect of concom m itant medications, age, disease, hypoxia and rapidly increasing concentrations on the vascular effects, explain ischaemic preconditioning in more detail, and com m ent on the clinical relevance of coronary steal."
- "Few candidates commented on the overall effect on oxygen balance, either at normal or high concentrations."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates included unnecessary data, such as physical properties, modes of administration, effects on other organ system s, or effects which are neither beneficial or adverse."
- "Common errors included circular reasoningâ€”a fall in VR causes a fall in CO, and confusing the effects of isoflurane and halothane."
