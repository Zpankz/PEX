title: "Outline how the pharmacokinetics of morphine, bupivacaine and suxamethonium differ in the neonate compared to the adult. Briefly describe the clinical implications of these differences."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 5
passRate: 73
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question asked candidates for som e applied pharmacology, looking at the effect of age on pharmacokinetics of three commonly used drugs."
- "The question was generally well answ ered, and a pass mark could be obtained by citing the critical features of each."
- "With regard to morphine, both clearance and glucuronidation is decreased in the neonate, leading to a prolonged half life. The more permeable blood brain barrier and relatively increased brain blood flow in neonates contributes to a greater sensitivity to the drug in the neonate."
- "With regard to bupivacaine there is an enhanced propensity for toxicity as a result of decreased protein binding, because of decreased alpha 1 glycoprotein levels, and decreased hepatic clearance."
- "With regard to suxamethonium , there are opposite forces at work. An enhanced ECF volume would lead to an increased volume of distribution w hich w ould tend to reduce activity, but this could be countered for by a decrease in pseudocholinesterase levels in the neonate. The end result clinically is little change in duration of action."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Marks were also awarded for mention of the influence of pH on toxicity in the neonate."
- "Extra marks were awarded w here candidates were able to give approximate dosages, or dosage ranges appropriate for the different drugs."
