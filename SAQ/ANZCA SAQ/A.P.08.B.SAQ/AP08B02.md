title: "Describe the pharmacokinetic principles of total intravenous anaesthesia using propofol."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 2
passRate: 52
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The essence of the question is for candidates to relate knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of propofol to what is being observed when propofol is being administered for total intravenous anaesthesia."
- "So it is important to explain why the rates of infusion vary at differing times such as at commencement, slightly after commencement and after a long period of infusion through reference to how the body is dealing with propofol."
- "The most points that attracted marks included brief definition of the goal of TIVA i.e. to reach and maintain a central com partm ent serum or effect site concentration of propofol at a level adequate for anaesthesia, descriptions, diagrams and equations which dealt w ith the im portance of an initial infusion providing a loading dose given high lipid solubility and central com partm ent volume of distribution, then the need to allow for redistribution and metabolism and then largely metabolism alone to maintain a steady serum or effect site concentration."
- "Also descriptions of how propofol behaves pharmacokinetically when TIVA is ceased received credit, as well as details of its clearance."
- "Propofol is a highly important drug critical to the practice of anaesthesia so a relatively high standard was expected."
EC_extraCredit:
- "There are many facts, diagrams and equations that attracted marks relating to propofol but the better marks were reserved for candidates who pointed out the significance of this information to what is happening with the syringe driver."
- "It should be pointed out that candidates who chose to explain pharmacokinetic behaviour in relation to total intravenous anaesthesia(TIVA) using only prose were not penalised if their explanations were clear and indicated an appropriate depth of knowledge."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "It is advisable that candidates not waste valuable time drawing molecules of propofol or writing long introductions that donâ€™t deal directly with the question that was asked."
