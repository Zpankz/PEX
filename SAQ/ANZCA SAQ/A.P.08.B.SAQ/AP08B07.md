title: "List the agents used therapeutically to reduce platelet function. Outline their mechanisms of action, adverse effects, mode of elimination and duration of action."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 7
passRate: 82
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Relevant agents for this question include aspirin, prodrugs at ADP receptor, antagonists at the IIB/IIIA receptor and phosphodiesterase inhibitors."
- "This question had the option of being answered in the form of a ‘table’ form at using dot points outlining the com ponents asked for about platelet function reduction."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Marks were enhanced by including explanation of how the drug action interferes e.g. blocking the IIB/IIIA receptor interrupts the binding of fibrinogen hence the failure of adhesion and aggregation of platelets."
- "The ‘thrombus/platelet’ diagram in Katzung page 544 illustrates in sum m ary form the information and it was included in some candidate answers."
- "Com m ents on dextran and thrombin inhibitors gained credit."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "There is always a risk of elaborating on adverse effects probably more than the marks allocated at the expense of time spent on other agents."
- "Medications whose unwanted side effects include platelet inhibition are not used therapeutically for that purpose thus not gaining marks."
