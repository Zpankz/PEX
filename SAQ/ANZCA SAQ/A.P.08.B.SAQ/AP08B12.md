title: "Detail the protective and regulatory roles of the liver."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 32
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question required a description of the liver as the interface between the gut and the body, and as a result of this, its role in protection from organisms and toxins and regulation of nutrient levels."
- "The protective role is primarily related to the removal of bacteria, endotoxins, and protein denaturation. This is primarily undertaken by the Kupffer Cells which are in the hepatic sinusoids. The action of these macrophages is an example of innate im m unity. Following their activation a series of events follow s including phagocytosis, complement activation, and recruitment of other cells."
- "The primary regulatory role of the liver is as a glucostat i.e. responding to both high and low blood glucose levels being presented to it by the portal circulation. Detail on how the liver achieves this balance was needed."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Bonus marks were also awarded for the following as examples of protection: toxin/drug modification, production of acute phase proteins, com plem ent and urea, action as a blood reservoir, and of regulation production of albumin in regulating oncotic pressure, bile in regulating fat and fat soluble vitamin absorption, bilirubin metabolism , hormone inactivation and production of both coagulation and anticoagulation proteins."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some candidates were confused about the action of insulin and glucagon in these processes."
- "Listing all liver functions did not address the question, which asked for detail on a limited area of liver function."
- "Some candidates focussed on minor details while missing the big picture such as failing to mention blood glucose regulation or any protective roles."
