title: "What is 2,3 DPG? How is it produced in the red blood cells and how does it interact with haemoglobin? What is its relevance in altitude exposure, anaemia, and stored blood?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2004
sitting: A
question: 11
passRate: 84
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Main points expected for a pass included a definition of 2,3 DPG, and a brief description of the metabolic pathway involved in production."
- "Also required was a description of the interaction with haemoglobin defining the right shift in the haemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve, with extra marks awarded for differences with fetal haemoglobin."
- "The role of pH change in altering the production of 2,3 DPG also attracted additional marks."
- "Required also were the role of 2,3 DPG in allowing increased oxygen delivery in anaemia and during altitude exposure, with additional marks awarded when the effects in the lung in the hypoxic environment were included."
- "The potential deleterious effects of a lack of 2,3 DPG in stored blood was also required, with additional points given for inclusion of time-scale, and discussion of the importance of different additives."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The use of diagrams aided in the explanations for most candidates."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "problems occurring when parts of the question were unanswered, or unclear."
