question: 3

EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected were: • An understanding of Fick's Law of Diffusion related to i) the structure of the skin, and ii) the properties of representative local anaesthetic agents. • Defining \"eutectic\", details of how EMLA is formulated and administered to overcome the barriers described in the first part of the question, and aspects of the pharmacology of lignocaine and prilocaine relevant to the use of EMLA."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates achieving high marks presented detailed, integrated information showing a higher degree of understanding in both parts of the question."
- "Candidates and tutors will find relevant information in \"Dermatological Pharmacology\" in Goodman & Gilman in addition to texts covering local anaesthetic pharmacology."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "There was confusion about the definition of \"eutectic\" with a number of candidates writing that it referred to a lowered boiling point of the mixture. A \"eutectic mixture\" is the mixture of constituents at a ratio that produces the lowest temperature melting point."
