title: "Explain how the kidney handles glucose. Describe the physiological consequences of glycosuria."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2004
sitting: A
question: 16
passRate: 57
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Points required for a pass were: • Glucose is freely filtered in the glomerulus and reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. • The mechanisms of re-absorption involve secondary active transport and facilitated diffusion. • The energy for this process is provided by Na/K ATPase. • The amount absorbed depends on the amount filtered (up to a transport maximum). • Glycosuria leads to: • Diuresis and dehydration – caused by osmotic effects and medullary dilution • Loss of sodium (and other electrolytes) – leading to hypovolaemia and subsequent homeostatic responses • Loss of energy substrate"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were given for: • Quantification of rate of re-absorption and glycosuria. • Details of (co)-transport mechanisms involved in re-absorption – SGLY and GLUT • Heterogeneity of the saturation of reabsorption mechanisms – manifest as “splay”. • Increased chance of urinary infection with glycosuria."
