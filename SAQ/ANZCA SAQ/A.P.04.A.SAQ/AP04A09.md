title: "Briefly outline the differences between the pulmonary circulation and the systemic circulation."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2004
sitting: A
question: 9
passRate: 26
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected for a pass were differences in anatomy, function, haemodynamics (especially pressure, resistance and the affect of lung volume and gravity) – regulation of the circulation and other functions such as filtering."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The best candidates were well organised, wrote only the differences between the circulations and gave brief explanations."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "to treat this as a compare and contrast question. Many candidates wrote how the pulmonary circulation was controlled and how the systemic circulation was controlled. Only the differences were required."
- "many candidates gave lists of the functions of the pulmonary circulation, not differences eg. The blood reservoir function of the lung which is also present in the systemic circulation."
- "to state eg. “pulmonary vascular resistance is affected by lung volume” and not to say how it is affected. A statement like this does not receive marks."
