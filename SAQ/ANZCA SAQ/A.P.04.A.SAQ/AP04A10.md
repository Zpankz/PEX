entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2004
sitting: A
question: 10
passRate: 65
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected for a pass were to describe the formation of these substances and pathways by which they interacted with vascular smooth muscle."
- "Also required was an understanding that these paracrine substances are vasoactive regulators, helping match regional perfusion to metabolic demand."
- "Additional points were awarded for listing the factors which stimulated or inhibited release of these substances; hormones, local metabolites and changes in wall tension."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The key vasoactive substances released from the endothelium are nitric oxide, prostacyclin and the endothelins."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common errors were to describe the role of the endothelium in coagulation in fibrinolysis, and to describe the physics of blood flow."
