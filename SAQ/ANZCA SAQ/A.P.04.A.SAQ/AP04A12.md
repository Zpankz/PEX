title: "What are the physiological consequences of decreasing functional residual capacity by one litre in an adult?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2004
sitting: A
question: 12
passRate: 50
EC_expectedDomains:
- "As described then, to achieve a pass, candidates were expected to cover the majority of the following points: • Some definition of FRC, being: • The equilibrium point of the lung & chest wall, or • The lung volume at the end of a normal tidal breath, or • Residual volume + Expiratory reserve volume • An approximate normal value: FRC ≈ 2.2L, or 30mL/kg. • FRC will fall below closing volume, resulting in: • Airway/alveolar closing with atelectasis • An increase in V/Q mismatch, shunt and arterial hypoxaemia • Increased work of breathing to open airways/alveoli • A decrease in lung compliance. • An increase in airways resistance • Increased work of breathing. • Increased pulmonary vascular resistance. • Decreased store of oxygen."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were attained for the following: • Quantification of “one litre” as a significant (~40-50%) decrease. • Increased work of breathing being multifactorial: • ↓ compliance, and • ↑airways resistance, and • critical opening pressure for collapsed alveoli • Decreased O2 store → • Increased breath-to-breath variation in PaO2 • Increased risk of hypoxaemia during induction of anaesthesia • Increased pulmonary vascular resistance → ↑ RV work • Graphs indicating effect of changing volume/FRC on: • Compliance • Airways resistance • Pulmonary vascular resistance"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates duplicated material, first listing the functions of FRC in-depth, and then listing the consequences of a decrease. While making a short list is a useful aid, repeating several pages of text gains no additional marks and wastes valuable time."
- "Some candidates wasted time writing about the measurement of FRC, the respiratory changes in pregnancy, which were not asked."
- "Vague answers, such as “may result in ABG deficits” are not considered sufficient in detail."
