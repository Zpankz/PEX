title: "Outline the effects of liver failure on drug kinetics and dynamics."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2004
sitting: A
question: 5
passRate: 52
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The effects on kinetics to outline included: • Absorption; decreased absorption eg; Vit K • Bioavailability; decreased first pass metabolism • Metabolism and decreased clearance; decreased enzymatic degradation with decreased clearance of low extraction ratio drugs, decreased hepatic blood flow and decreased clearance of high extraction ratio drugs, decreased pseudocholinesterase levels, decreased biliary excretion and potentially decreased renal clearance • Distribution; increased volume of distribution for water soluble drugs, decreased levels of albumin and acid glycoprotein with decreased protein binding"
- "The effects on dynamics to outline included: • Encephalopathy and potential interaction with CNS depressants • Coagulopathy and potential drug interactions • Potential for increased hepatotoxicity"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates frequently did not outline the effects on metabolism, biliary excretion, protein binding and pharmacodynamics."
