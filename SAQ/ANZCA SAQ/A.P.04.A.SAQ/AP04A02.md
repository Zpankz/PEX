title: "Outline factors determining speed of onset of neuromuscular blocking agents."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2004
sitting: A
question: 2
passRate: 71
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main factors for a pass mark were: • Dose of agent noting that multiples of ED95 had faster onset of action compared to lower doses. • Potency of the agent noting that more potent agents have a slower onset of action compared to equivalent doses of a less potent agent, with an explanation of this effect. • The effect of cardiac output and the perfusion to muscle groups to distribute the agent. • Relevant physicochemical properties of the agents and an explanation of their relevance."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for identifying and explaining the differences in speed of onset between depolarising muscle relaxants and non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking agents, discussion of the different speed of onset between different muscle types and groups, the effects of different routes and sites of administration and the priming principle on speed of onset, the effects of other drugs and the effects of age and relevant disease states."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates confused the term dose with the term concentration. The two are significantly different and are not interchangeable."
- "Description of Fick’s Law without any attempt to interpret or explain its relevance to the question."
- "There appeared to be considerable confusion between the term speed of onset and the term onset time. An increased speed of onset will result in a reduction of the onset time. Great latitude was given in this matter but candidates are advised to consistently refer to one or the other to avoid confusion and not use the terms interchangeably"
