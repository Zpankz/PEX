EC_expectedDomains:
- "Expected in the answer was a labelled diagram including mask, valves, self- inflating bag, oxygen input and reservoir bag."
- "Discussion was expected to include the role of each of these parts in the function of the device."
- "A good way to discuss function was to explain the flow of gas through the device in both inspiration and expiration."
- "An understanding of the key role of the non- rebreathing valve in both inspiration and expiration was expected for a pass."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "There were a large number of candidates who described a device with a flow inflating bag such as a T-piece or other Mapleson circuits."
- "These circuits are however valveless unlike the BVM device."
- "Lack of understanding of the function of the valves in the BVM was a common reason for a candidate to not pass this question."
- "The bag inlet valve was also frequently omitted."
- "There was additional misunderstanding about the role and location of PEEP valves and APL valves in the device."
