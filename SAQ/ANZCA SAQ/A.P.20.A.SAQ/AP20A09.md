title: "Outline the effects of opioids injected into the spinal intrathecal space using both fentanyl and morphine to illustrate your answer."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2020
sitting: A
question: 9
passRate: 75
EC_expectedDomains:
- "In order to score a passing mark for this question candidates needed to demonstrate a knowledge of both the desirable and undesirable clinical effects of intrathecal injection of opioids, some pharmacodynamic reasons for these effects (anatomical locations, receptors and cellular effects of the drugs), the pharmacokinetic differences between fentanyl and morphine which explain their different desirable and undesirable clinical effects."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers gave more detailed explanations of particular supraspinal and spinal nocioception pathways and centres, explained in detail the reasons for the four most important side effects of spinal opioids (nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, pruritus and respiratory depression), and offered detail in differentiating between both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of the two drugs in question."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates failed because they entirely missed or gave cursory and inadequate attention to one or more of these areas."
- "Common errors included attribution of pruritus to a systemic histamine effect, an attribution of the analgesic effects of fentanyl to systemic absorption, an assertion that intrathecal opioids cause significant motor, sensory or sympathetic blockade, and incorrect descriptions of significant cardiovascular side effects of intrathecal opioids."
