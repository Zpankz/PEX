title: "Describe the time course between an intravenous injection of a general anaesthetic agent to loss of consciousness. Explain the delay using pharmacokinetic principles."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2020
sitting: A
question: 13
passRate: 87
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question had two parts, one asking about the time course between an intravenous injection of anaesthetic agent to loss of consciousness, the other asking to use pharmacokinetic principles."
- "The domains covered were the concept of the effect site and determining ke0, factors which contribute to the change in plasma concentration over time, diffusion and to a lesser extent effect site changes that result in loss of consciousness (e.g receptor binding, activation and change of resting membrane potential)"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Those who could, generally did very well."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates simply stated Fickâ€™s law of diffusion and discussed the factors responsible for a drug moving across a plasma membrane with no mention of pharmacokinetic principles."
- "A description of the role of the effect site equilibration rate constant (ke0) and equilibrium half-life (t1/2ke0) in the delay in onset was expected."
- "Candidates mentioned ke0 with a brief definition but very few were able to give explanations about what drug factor altered the constant or how differing intravenous agents differ in their equilibrium half-life that lead to different onset times."
- "Discussions about absorption were superfluous for an intravenous agent."
- "Likewise lengthy discussions about metabolism when discussing time to loss of consciousness were unnecessary."
