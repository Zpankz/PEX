title: "Compare and contrast the effects of sevoflurane and nitrous oxide on the cardiovascular system."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2020
sitting: A
question: 4
passRate: 31
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The major domains assessed in this question were General – dose dependency, comparison of doses used, understanding of differences between agents and Pharmacodynamics – Mechanisms and effects of both agents on cardiovascular parameters"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Credit was given for other relevant correct material including clinical utility of combining agents at reduced doses to promote cardiovascular stability."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Not providing a mechanism for Nitrous Oxide’s cardiovascular effects"
- "Not providing a reason why Sevoflurane and Nitrous Oxide have different effects Not describing the dose dependent nature of effects seen"
- "Omitting effects on pulmonary vasculature"
- "Omitting effects on regional circulations"
- "Inaccurate effect of Sevoflurane on the baroreceptor reflex"
- "There was confusion about how cardiovascular parameters interacted."
- "Many candidates incorrectly stated that cardiac output decreases due to decreased systemic vascular resistance or that decreased cardiac output was the main cause of decreased mean arterial pressure with Sevoflurane."
