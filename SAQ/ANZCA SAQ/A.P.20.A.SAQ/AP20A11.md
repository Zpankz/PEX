title: "An infusion of 50mls of 50% dextrose is given to a healthy 70kg adult. Describe the possible metabolic pathways for the dextrose."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2020
sitting: A
question: 11
passRate: 89
EC_expectedDomains:
- "In order to pass, an answer had to address the domains of: Glucose utilisation pathways, Glucose storage pathways, namely glycogen and fat stores and Hormonal regulation of the pathways, in particular the effects of insulin on target tissues."
EC_extraCredit:
- "While it was not necessary to provide detailed reactions of the metabolic pathways, credit was awarded for naming of major intermediaries, enzymes, receptors, relative amounts of energy released by different pathways and other relevant information."
- "Many good answers used flow diagrams effectively to demonstrate the relevant pathways."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common problems and errors included: Entirely omitting one of the domains, Limiting discussion of storage pathways to either glycogen or fat, Incorrect utilisation of the terms “glycogenesis” and “glycogenolysis”, Nomenclature of GLUT transporters, their locations and insulin responsiveness, Calculation of the dose (ranging from 2.5g to 25 000g), Identifying dextrose as a carbohydrate polymer or molecule that needs to be broken down or converted to glucose, Conversion of glucose to amino acids and/or proteins and Discussion of an osmotic effect and ADH response"
