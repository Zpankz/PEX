title: "Describe the mechanisms that facilitate oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange in the placenta."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2020
sitting: A
question: 5
passRate: 68
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The domains covered were transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide, diffusion, and other factors."
- "Main points expected were: description of how gases diffuse across the placenta with relevance to Fick’s Law and in comparison to the lung, quantification of partial pressure differences for oxygen & carbon dioxide between the vessels involved, and definitions with explanations for the Bohr & Haldane effects applied to the placental barrier."
- "Graphical demonstrations could show the effect of these mechanisms on diffusion gradients."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional credit was awarded for explaining the mechanism & significance of the Bohr & Haldane effects, understanding other factors which alter the partial pressure gradients, maternal changes by trimester and the effects of blood flow on diffusion."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common errors included: misconception that the gradient for oxygen transfer was derived from the uterine artery PO2, attributing the Bohr effect solely to CO2 binding to Hb, and quoted values for uterine & umbilical vessel gas partial pressures were frequently inaccurate as were graphs, and there seemed to be many “typos” e.g. writing O2 when CO2 was correct or umbilical instead of uterine."
