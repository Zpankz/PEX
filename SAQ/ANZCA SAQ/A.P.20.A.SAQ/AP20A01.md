title: "Outline the possible reasons for prolonged paralysis induced by an intravenous dose of 1 mg/kg of suxamethonium."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2020
sitting: A
question: 1
passRate: 89
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The domains assessed on this question were the pharmacology of suxamethonium in a normal individual (i.e. what is the normal dose, duration of action and why), the significance of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), quantitative defects/deficiencies in BChE, qualitative defects in BChE and other non-metabolic factors affecting duration."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common failures included lack of addressing all domains, especially insufficient knowledge of the genetics of BChE, or failure to mention anything other than genetic defects in BChE."
- "Many candidates were keen to assume a drug error, even though the question specifically stated a dose of 1mg/kg given intravenously."
- "Some candidates incorrectly stated that suxamethonium is metabolised at the NMJ by acetylcholinesterase."
