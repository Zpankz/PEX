title: "Describe the washout of desflurane from a patient following six hours of general anaesthesia. Draw a graph to illustrate the description."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2020
sitting: A
question: 7
passRate: 85
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The major domains assessed in this question were: A description of the shape of the washout curve, Factors which would affect the time course of washout and A graph illustrating the description."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The most common problem was that the graph did not illustrate the description."
- "It is important to give some idea of the time course of the washout and to indicate in some way that the washout is some form of exponential decay."
- "Marking important points on the graph make it easier to illustrate the description."
- "Other common issues were using the blood gas partition coefficient to explain tissue solubility or to say that low lipid solubility leads to a slow tissue washin but a fast washout."
