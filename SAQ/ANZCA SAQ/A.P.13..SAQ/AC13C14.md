title: "Briefly describe the structure of mitochondria. Outline the metabolic processes that occur in mitochondria."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2013
sitting: C
question: 14
passRate: 37
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To pass \n• Description of mitochondrion: \n• intracellular organelle \n• Inner and outer membrane \n• Central matrix \n• Cristae (folds in inner membrane)"
- "Second part \n• Main function is oxidative phoshphorylation \n• Needed to explain Krebs cycle (where it occurs,substrate,products:NADH and FADH2,)"
- "Also needed to explain electron transport chain: where, substrates, how it works, purpose and product."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks : \n• stating matrix site of Krebs cycle and ETC on inner membrane with H ions abundant in intermembrane space. \n• increased number in metabolically active tissue. \n• Some cells lack mitochondria e.g. RBC \n• DNA (smaller genome, maternal inheritance) \n• T RNA \n• Ribosomes present"
- "Extra marks for stating CO2 produced from this cycle, NADH creates 3 ATP FADH2 creates 2 ATP."
- "Extra marks for \n• correct stoichiometry, \n• naming the cytochrome enzymes, \n• appreciating 3 of the 5 complexes pump H+ out of the matrix into the inter membrane space against a concentration gradient, \n• describing the H+ ion passing down an electochem gradient via ATP synthase to facilitate ADP→ATP, \n• stating O2 is final electron acceptor, metabolic water produced and overall 36 ATP for 1 mol glucose"
- "Other functions: \n• Drug biotransformation \n• Apoptosis (programmed cell death) \n• Ca sequestration"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This question was poorly answered overall however some candidates scored very well."
- "The question came in 2 parts. Many candidates did not address the structure of the mitochondrion and this cost around one third of the potential mark."
