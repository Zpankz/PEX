title: "What are the advantages and disadvantages of xenon as an anaesthetic agent?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2013
sitting: C
question: 2
passRate: 38
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Most candidates were able to recite the physicochemical properties of xenon gas."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Other important advantages of xenon include that it is not metabolized and xenon is insoluble. Wash-in and wash-out of the gas can therefore be achieved quickly. Xenon anesthesia also does not suppress the myocardium."
- "It should be noted that xenon does not trigger malignant hyperthermia, and has been regarded as safe for MHS patients."
- "However, few could indicate the clinical relevance of these features. For instance, most candidates correctly pointed out that xenon is a non-pungent and odorless gas, but few could identify this as an advantage for inhalational induction."
- "However, many candidates missed out the analgesic properties of xenon."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Important disadvantages of xenon are that it is very expensive to use, and that the high MAC value (71%) limits the delivery of higher inspiratory concentration of oxygen."
- "A number of candidates listed the features of an ideal inhalational anesthetic agent, which was not asked for in the question."
