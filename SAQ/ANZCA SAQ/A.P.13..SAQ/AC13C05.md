title: "Discuss the concept of volume of distribution. How may it be used in the calculation of a loading dose? What assumptions are made in this calculation?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2013
sitting: C
question: 5
passRate: 29
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Marks were allocated for a correct definition and a basic formula for calculating Vd."
- "The primary assumption is that the calculation is based on a single compartment model or the Vd at steady state."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were also allocated for clear explanations about why it is called the apparent volume of distribution and how the calculated volumes can greatly exceed the physical volumes in the body. Descriptions about single versus multi-compartment modelling also scored marks."
- "Further marks were also obtained for describing drug, physiological, and pathological factors that affected a drug’s Vd."
- "Extra marks were given for providing relevant examples of drugs."
- "Bonus marks were awarded for using relevant drug examples."
- "Bonus marks were also awarded for discussion about using other variants of Vd in the calculation, e.g. Vdpe, etc., as well as discussing assumptions about bioavailability and clearance."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Depending on the drug’s distribution, this can sometimes lead to very high initial peak plasma levels with the potential for toxicity."
