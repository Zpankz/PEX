title: "How does a fall in temperature influence blood gas solubility and acid base values?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2013
sitting: C
question: 13
passRate: 24
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question sought information on how a fall in temperature influences blood gas solubility and acid base values."
- "This required candidates to address the fundamentals of temperature (e.g. a relationship with kinetic energy) and gas solubility (which changes with altered kinetic energy)."
- "This included Henryâ€™s Law, and understanding that a change in solubility will alter the content: partial pressure ratio."
- "The direction and causes of pH changes were required."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Inclusion of discussion on alpha and pH stat gained additional marks, as did discussion of Hb dissociation curve shifts."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Overall, candidates frequently scored low marks. Causes of this included: little knowledge of the area, misinterpretation of the question, and frank misunderstandings of the effects of hypothermia."
- "It was common that candidates had hypothermia-induced partial pressure changes, and solubility changes, inverted."
- "The cause of pH changes was not well understood."
- "Inclusion of areas such as an effect of hypothermia on diffusion and cardiovascular/perfusion changes, did not attract marks."
