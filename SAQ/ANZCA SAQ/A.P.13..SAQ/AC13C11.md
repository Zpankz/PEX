title: "Compare and contrast lung function in the neonate with that in an adult."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2013
sitting: C
question: 11
passRate: 5
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question required a comparison of neonatal & adult lung function to achieve full marks for any given point; this was most efficiently presented in a tabular format."
- "The main points expected for a pass included: definition of a neonate, physiologically relevant anatomy, mechanics (compliance, lung volumes, resistance), ventilatory parameters, gas exchange & control of breathing."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Marks were also awarded for demonstrating physiological relevance (e.g. obligate nasal breathers with high upper airway resistance which provides auto-PEEP)."
- "Additional marks were given for brief mention of non-respiratory functions of the lung."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common mistakes included vague statements lacking quantification or magnitude of difference (e.g. higher or lower), contradictory statements regarding compliance (e.g. lungs are stiffer so compliance is increased), & incorrect information regarding dead space difference between adult & neonate."
- "Extensive notes on upper airway anatomy relevant to intubation & management of anaesthesia attracted no marks."
- "Similarly, events at birth with fetal transition did not attract marks nor was HbF considered relevant to lung function unless presented in the context of the diffusion barrier."
