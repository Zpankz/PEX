entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2013
sitting: C
question: 9
passRate: 12
EC_expectedDomains:
- "An adequate answer to this question would describe the components of the reflex arc, with particular attention to the efferent limb due to its complexity."
- "Good candidates could describe the interplay of laryngeal and respiratory muscles in stages in the generation of a cough."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Understanding this reflex and how to modify it is important to practise safe anaesthesia."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The cough reflex is an important protective airway mechanism, which paradoxically anaesthetists often need to suppress."
- "The question was, however, generally poorly answered."
- "The reflex arc was frequently outlined but with insufficient detail."
- "There were many incorrect statements, for example, a sizable minority of candidates described the diaphragm as a muscle of exhalation, responsible directly for the forceful expulsion of air from the lungs."
- "It appeared that few candidates had considered the physiology of coughing and had difficulty integrating some relatively simple respiratory physiology in the stress of the exam."
- "Mindful practice of novel questions is a useful study technique."
