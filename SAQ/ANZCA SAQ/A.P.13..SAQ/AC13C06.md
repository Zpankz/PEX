title: "Sevoflurane and fentanyl are a common anaesthetic drug combination. Discuss pharmacological reasons why it is useful to use them together."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2013
sitting: C
question: 6
passRate: 62
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The classifications of both sevoflurane and fentanyl were well defined."
- "Moreover the pharmacodynamics of their actions and the side effects associated with these were also well described."
- "Included were good explanations of the beneficial modulating effects that the two agents do have on the pharmacodynamic effects of each other e.g. analgesia, cardiovascular parameters."
- "The question does ask about the pharmacology pertaining to choosing to use the two agents together."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Discussion of onset and offset relationships, lack of competition in distribution, protein binding, metabolism or elimination indicated that the two agents do have minimal kinetic interaction."
- "Some extra marks were gained by the inclusion of a graph that related the synergism, factors which make the reduced dosages of agents influence cost and greenhouse effects."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This was, perhaps, at times at the expense of mentioning some aspects of the pharmacokinetics pertaining to these two agents."
