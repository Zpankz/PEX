title: "Describe the effects of giving an unopposed dose of neostigmine."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2016
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 28
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This was a question of two parts."
- "It was possible to pass the question with only information about the muscarinic receptor effects, but it required a high level of detail to do this."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good candidates were able to explain how neostigmine works, why neostigmine is given, when it is appropriate to give neostigmine, discuss the effects at both the nicotinic and muscarinic receptors and apply clinical relevance to both."
- "Extra marks were awarded for applying clinical relevance to the question, particularly if candidates explained why an antimuscarinic medication is usually co-administered when neostigmine is used to reverse non-depolarising muscle blockade."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The majority of candidates answered this question as a ‘side-effects of neostigmine’ question, but did not include any information about the effects of neostigmine at the nicotinic receptors."
- "Outside of bradycardia, the cardiac effects were generally poorly-covered."
- "Non-specific comments such as “urination” did not attract marks, whereas a point such as “increases ureteric peristalsis may lead to urination” did."
