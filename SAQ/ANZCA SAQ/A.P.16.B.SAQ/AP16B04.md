title: "Outline the physiology of blood groupings that allows O negative packed cells to be safely transfused to most patients."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2016
sitting: B
question: 4
passRate: 75
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Main points expected for a pass: • Neg status is determined by the ABO and Rhesus blood groups • A classification of ABO system according to antigens expressed on the RBCs • Recognition that antibodies (Abs) develop in the plasma against non-self ABO antigens (and to delineate these) • Classification of the Rhesus system based on the presence or absence of the Rhesus antigen • Recognition that ABO incompatibility results when donor RBCs expressing an antigen (A &/or B) which recipient does not possess are transfused. The recipient will have antibodies to the foreign antigen in their plasma, resulting in an immune reaction. • Recognition that O Neg blood cells express no A or B antigens and no Rhesus antigen and hence will not provoke an immune response when transfused to most."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional credit was gained for discussion of: • the ABO system as the most antigenic • how the ABO Abs are formed after birth and their nature • the Rhesus system having multiple alleles, but the D allele as the most important • the need for prior exposure to the D antigen to produce anti-D antibodies (unlike ABO Abs) and the importance of avoiding this sensitization esp in women of childbearing age (hence the use of Rh – blood) • rare blood groups eg the Bombay blood group where O neg blood may cause an immune reaction • other more minor blood antigens which may cause reaction in sensitized patients • the importance of removing plasma from the donated RBCs (as O plasma contains both anti-A and anti-B antibodies) • the utility of O Neg blood in emergency situations with critical time pressures"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The most common error was the description of antibodies against the ABO antigens as “A Abs & B Abs” when they are actually anti-A Abs and Anti-B Abs."
