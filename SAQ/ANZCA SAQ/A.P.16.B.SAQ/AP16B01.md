title: "Describe the respiratory effects of adding positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) to intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2016
sitting: B
question: 1
passRate: 57
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A pass could be achieved by acknowledging that anaesthesia causes a reduction in the FRC, that PEEP is applied to mitigate this effect, by outlining the effects on compliance and airway resistance that occurs, and by showing an understanding that this improves FRC in relation to closing capacity thereby recruiting dependent airways, improving V/Q matching and hence oxygenation."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Answers that included comments on the adverse effects of PEEP generally scored better."
- "Many candidates correctly drew the pulmonary compliance curve, and accurately described the increase in compliance (right shift) that occurs with the application of PEEP, however few went on to describe the reduction in compliance that occurs with 'over-PEEPâ€™ and the damage this many cause."
- "Candidates who correctly acknowledge that PEEP provides benefits at extubation, and its use is associated with less atelectrauma, shear stress and inflammatory response scored extra marks."
- "Cardiovascular effects of PEEP only gained marks when describing V/Q changes that may occur and the effect of PEEP on PaO2."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This question was repeated from the last exam where the pass rate was 1%."
- "Unfortunately many of these marks were missed by candidates who spend time on definitions of PEEP, IPPV and describing the modes (pressure and volume) of ventilation that can be used, which no marks were awarded for."
- "Few answers had the x-axis of the compliance curve correctly labelled with positive pressure numbers reflecting a lack of integration of book knowledge into the answer."
- "PEEP does not prolong apnoea time at anaesthesia induction (RSI) by providing a increased oxygen reservoir, because it has not been applied until after intubation and commencement of ventilation."
- "A reduction in work of breathing (due to improved compliance and reduced airway resistance) does occur with optimal FRC, however in a mechanically ventilated patient this is manifested by a reduction in ventilator pressures and effort by the machine rather than energy expenditure from the patient."
