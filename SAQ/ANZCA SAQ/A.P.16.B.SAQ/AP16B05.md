entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2016
sitting: B
question: 5
passRate: 47
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question required a well organised approach to score highly."
- "Acknowledging adipose tissue as an endocrine organ with brief description of the relevant mechanism of action of the principal hormones involved then segues into discussion of the physiological CVS changes."
- "Main points expected included changes in blood volume, cardiac output, heart rate, stroke volume, contractility and the ECG. Effects on blood pressure as distinct from systemic hypertension was expected."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for demonstrating understanding of left and right ventricular pathophysiology, hypercoagulopathy, the role of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and the reasons for exercise being poorly tolerated. Latitude was given for confusion around the term obesity cardiomyopathy."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Information was sometimes presented effectively in flow chart diagrams but explanatory detail was often missing in this approach."
- "Explanations of BMI grades attracted no marks nor did extensive discussion of comorbid conditions."
- "Common mistakes included vague statements especially with respect to systemic vascular resistance, repetition of information and incorrect information especially with respect to eccentric and concentric hypertrophy."
- "Terms such as wall stress, tension, afterload, and myocardial work were often used loosely."
- "The use of arrows on each new line suggesting a causal relation to the preceding statement was often perplexing."
