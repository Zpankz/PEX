EC_expectedDomains:
- "The anatomy needed to cover the origin, pathway down the neck, termination, and structures related to the right internal jugular vein."
- "In discussing central line insertion information required included the positioning of the patient, landmarks used for the common approaches, needle angle, and advantages of using the right internal jugular vein."
- "The use of ultrasound for vessel identification needed to be covered."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Often text-based information gained more marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "There were problems with diagrams in that they were commonly poorly drawn and attracted few additional marks, due to errors, no level specified for cross-sections, lack of labels, and a poor relationship to how human anatomy actually looks."
- "Common incorrect statements included the foramen magnum as the origin, absent right thoracic duct, and margins of the anterior triangle of the neck."
- "Discussion of the indications, equipment required, and complications of central line insertion generally did not attract marks."
