title: "Explain the mechanisms by which intravenous morphine produces analgesia. Your answer should focus on the location and function of mu opioid receptors."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2016
sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 29
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question essentially asks three things; the mechanism of action of morphine with as much detail about receptor and intermediate messenger pathways as possible, the anatomical location of mu opioid receptors, and the specific role of morphine in modifying pain pathways through its influence on the mu receptor at these locations."
- "In general the mechanism of morphine action was discussed well but the way in which this mechanism ties in with phyisiologic transmission of pain was handled less well."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates who were able to discuss these three factors in detail achieved a good score with the question."
- "Discussions of analgesic effects of morphine and potential mechanisms that explain longer term effects of tolerance and hyperalgesia were allowed and also attracted marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The following did not attract marks: • Drawing the morphine molecule. • Providing pharmacokinetic information. • Discussing pain pathways without looking at how the morphine mechanism impacts on the pain pathways. • Complex discussions of Fick’s law of diffusion. • Drawing diagrams of pain pathways and still needing to explain mechanisms on top of this; something which took up too much valuable time."
