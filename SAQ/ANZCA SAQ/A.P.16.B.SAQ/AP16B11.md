title: "a) Briefly describe the bactericidal activity of gentamicin. Explain why it is usually administered as a single daily dose. b) Describe the potential toxic effects of gentamicin."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2016
sitting: B
question: 11
passRate: 20
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question had two parts, with part a) having two sub-sections. Marks were apportioned accordingly."
- "The question asked about three specific aspects of gentamicin’s pharmacology"
- "Describing the antibacterial spectrum with some examples and mentioning that bactericidal meant killing cells attracted marks."
- "Brief details about the bactericidal mechanism were also helpful - i.e. gentamicin binds to ribosomes causing mRNA mistranslation, creating abnormal proteins that disrupt cellular machinery and the integrity of the cell wall."
- "Part b) asked for a description of the toxic effects of gentamicin and was answered better than part a)."
- "Marks were given for describing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, including their clinical features, frequency, contributing and exacerbating factors and the reversibility or otherwise of these effects."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Including the potential for muscle weakness, interactions with muscle relaxants and mechanisms also scored marks."
- "However, even a well-drawn graph added a little to a written explanation."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates wasted time writing in general terms and providing factually correct but irrelevant information (e.g. bioavailability, drug presentation)."
- "Many candidates assumed, incorrectly, that once daily dosing was due to a long half-life."
- "Few candidates were able to explain this satisfactorily. The crux of the question is recognising that gentamicin has a short half-life, so should require more frequent dosing. Daily dosing with a higher dose produces an initial high (bactericidal) concentration that falls below the minimum inhibitory concentration but retains a residual bactericidal activity (the so called “post antibiotic effect”). The main benefit being accumulation and toxic effects of gentamicin are reduced."
- "Many drew graphs but few were of a form that looked like an actual drug concentration versus time curve."
