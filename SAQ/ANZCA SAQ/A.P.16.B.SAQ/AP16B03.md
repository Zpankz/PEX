title: "Explain the physiological processes that cause oliguria in response to hypovolaemic shock."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2016
sitting: B
question: 3
passRate: 33
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question required candidates to provide definitions of oliguria and hypovolaemic shock followed by a succinct but detailed description of how hypovoalemia activated the sympathetic nervous system, with subsequent activation of the renin/angiotensin/aldosterone system (RAAS) and antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) release, either from sympathetic stimulation, RAAS or changes in osmolarity."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most answers correctly defined shock as inadequate tissue perfusion, but some candidates still defined shock in terms of an absolute blood pressure."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Ranges for oliguria varied from 0.5 mLs/Kg/Hr to 30 mLs/Kg/Hr."
- "The commonest reason for a low scoring answer was purely inadequate detail. Most respondents were able to give a broad overview of the basic mechanisms but failed to elaborate. Simple statements such as ‘activation of RAAS’ or equations related to filtration coefficient and capillary pressures without explanations how they effected oliguria, in the setting of hypovolaemic shock, were insufficient to gain marks."
- "Frequent mistakes included mentioning RAAS but then neglecting one or more of its components, suggesting renin converted angiotensin I to angiotensin II, only mentioning 1 or 2 actions of angiotensin II, and neglecting the actions of ADH at V1 receptors to mediate vasoconstriction."
- "As in previous years, the range of renal autoregulation parameters, when given, was frequently incorrect. A minority of candidates gave the correct value (50-150 mmHg)."
