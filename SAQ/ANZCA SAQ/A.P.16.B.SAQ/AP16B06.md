title: "Discuss the determinants and control of spinal cord perfusion."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2016
sitting: B
question: 6
passRate: 51
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question is primarily a physiological oriented one."
- "Most candidates did describe the anatomical aspects of the cord arterial and venous components."
- "Marks were gained for naming and drawing the cord's vascular supply."
- "Realising that the parameters of perfusion of cord tissue are akin to that of the intra -cerebral perfusion, the considerations needed for this question fall into place for candidates."
- "Systemic physiological measurements of MAP, CVP, ICP, vascular flow dynamics as described in terms of Pousieulle's law, Monroe- Kellie doctrine all apply and could be logged into the determinants of spinal cord perfusion."
- "Adding the effects of local factors eg ph, pC02and pa02, a complete multifactorial physiological synopsis is outlined. Autoregulation behaves as does the intracerebral circulation."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Some mention of the peri- operative, trauma, medications and space occupying lesions indicated further applied understanding of the significance of the question and attained further credit."
