title: "Describe the effect of a pregnancy, at term, on wash-in of volatile anaesthetic agents."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2016
sitting: B
question: 13
passRate: 33
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question was principally about the pharmacokinetic implications of term pregnancy for volatile anaesthetic wash-in."
- "Main points expected for a pass: • The rate of volatile wash-in is determined by the balance of delivery to the alveolus vs uptake from the alveolus. Wash-in can be demonstrated graphically with an FA/FI curve. • At term pregnancy there is an increase in minute ventilation. There is also a reduction in the functional residual capacity (which is exaggerated in the supine, anaesthetised patient)."
- "Volatile uptake is affected by blood-gas solubility, cardiac output changes in pregnancy, and the arterio-venous volatile pressure gradient."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers discussed these respiratory changes, their magnitude, the effect on volatile wash-in and an explanation of why these effects occur."
- "Better scoring answers contained a detailed discussion of these issues and explained their effect on volatile wash-in."
- "Few candidates mentioned that at term pregnancy, volatile anaesthetic is usually given in the setting of a general anaesthetic with an intubated and paralyzed patient – where minute ventilation is controlled by the anesthetist."
- "Few mentioned that the overall effect is an increased speed of wash-in with the effects on the respiratory system outweighing those on the cardiovascular system."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates spent a lot of time discussing pharmacodynamic changes in pregnancy, including its effect on MAC. This was not awarded any marks."
- "Similarly many candidates spent too much time listing all of the physiological changes in pregnancy, or all of the factors involved in volatile wash-in, including many that were not relevant to the question."
- "It was clear that there was confusion with terminology – with wash-in, uptake, and rate of onset all used interchangeably by many candidates."
- "Some candidates spent time writing about wash-out, which was not relevant to the question."
- "FA/FI graphs were often drawn incorrectly, with unlabelled axes. Some were labelled as FI/FA curves."
