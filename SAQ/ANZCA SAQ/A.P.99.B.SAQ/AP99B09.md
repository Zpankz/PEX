EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many answers showed poor understanding not just of confidence intervals (CI) but also the principles of statistical inference concerning samples and populations."
- "In addition, it was surprising that many answers referred to the 95% CI as a single value, or neglected to mention 95% in their definition."
- "Many statements did not make sense grammatically or logically e.g. \"95% certain that the sample mean lies within the population mean\"."
- "The use of the term \"sample population\" prevented marks from being awarded because it was not certain whether the candidate meant sample or population."
- "Other common errors were statements such as \"95% CI has a 95% probability of containing the sample mean\"; and the incorrect formula that 95% CI = 1.96Â±SEM."
- "There was confusion regarding the significance of a CI containing zero. This depends on what the particular CI is providing an estimate for."
- "Many candidates wrote unnecessary information about P values without comparing them to CI, and many thought incorrectly that CI could not be used for hypothesis testing."
