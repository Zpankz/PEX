title: "How does a fall in temperature influence blood gas solubility and acid base values?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 1999
sitting: B
question: 1
passRate: 28
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates need to remember that this is primarily an examination of physical and physiological principles, often in the context of patient management, rather than of pathophysiology."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Effects of temperature on haemoglobin/oxygen affinity were also mentioned, and were generally well understood by candidates."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "There was considerable confusion about the basic physical principles involved, in particular concerning Henry's Law."
- "Decreased temperature also affects pH, which was generally overlooked by candidates when attempting to apply the Henderson-Hasselbach equation to explain this effect."
- "Alpha-stat and pH-stat strategies of blood gas interpretation were again often misunderstood."
resources:
- "Refer to Nunn, Blitt & Hines, and Scurr & Feldman."
