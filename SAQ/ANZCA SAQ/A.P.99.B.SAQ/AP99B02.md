title: "What physiological factors contribute to the competence and tone of the lower oesophageal sphincter?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 1999
sitting: B
question: 2
passRate: 42
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points sought were that the area is anatomically indistinguishable from other portions of the oesophagus, although containing an increased number of nerve cells. It is however able to maintain a higher pressure."
- "A discussion of the anatomical factors contributing to the competency was expected. These include: • A functional flap valve of gastric mucosa • Oblique entry into the stomach • Effect of diaphragm • Lower oesophagus exposed to intra abdominal pressure • Increased tone of circular muscle in sphincter"
- "A description of the concept of barrier pressure, with the inclusion of physiological pressures encountered was expected."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Describing other factors including the hormones that may alter tone of the sphincter e.g. Gastrin, motilin, PGE2, oestrogen, progesterone, glucagon, secretin, cholecystokinin & VIP, gained additional marks."
- "Physical factors such as elevated intra abdominal pressure and reduced gastric pH, should have been mentioned."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates gave excellent papers on the anatomical contributing factors and failed to mention the hormonal or physical factors. The reverse was also the case. Although scoring well on the aspect that they discussed, they often only managed a borderline pass."
- "Some candidates discussed pharmacological manipulation of the sphincter. This was not asked in the question and although done very well in many instances, was not rewarded with additional marks."
