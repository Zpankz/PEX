question: 5

EC_expectedDomains:
- "The relative importance of the ways in which carbon dioxide is carried in arterial and in venous blood, and an account of why the percentages differ on the venous side was expected."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A good account of the factors making up the Haldane effect and their relative importance was a feature of the better answers."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates gave an adequate account of carbon dioxide carriage as bicarbonate ions. Fewer discussed the chloride shift and very few went on to mention the implications on venous blood haematocrit."
- "Carriage of carbon dioxide as carbamino compounds was generally not as well accounted for as the other forms of carbon dioxide carriage."
- "Candidates are reminded that carboxyhaemoglobin (carbonmonoxyhaemoglobin) refers to the carriage of carbon monoxide on haemoglobin. A discussion of carboxyhaemoglobin was not requested."
