title: "Explain the mechanisms that maintain cerebral blood flow on moving from a supine to a standing position."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 1999
sitting: B
question: 6
passRate: 51
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The answer should have divided the mechanisms into global and local."
- "Since a significant amount of the answer revolves around pressures, its relationship to flow and resistance should have been highlighted."
- "The global response revolves around restoring MAP via baroreceptors. The venous pump and valves minimising the pooling effect is also relevant. Again this needs to be tied in with the question, i.e. CPP=MAP-CVP (ICP)."
- "The local factors have to include the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow, with the myogenic and local metabolic theories quickly outlined."
- "The Munroe-Kellie doctrine along with the relationship of the perfusion pressure to ICP and CVP, also helps to explain the postural effect on venous pressure and intracranial pressure favouring flow."
EC_extraCredit:
- "This all leaves us with a final balance of about a 20% decrease in cerebral blood flow."
