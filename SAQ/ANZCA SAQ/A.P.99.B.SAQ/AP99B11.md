title: "Outline the toxicity of local anaesthetics."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 1999
sitting: B
question: 11
passRate: 36
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Essential features expected in an answer were the causative factors and manifestations of toxicity in both the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system, together with a comparison of the blood levels (e.g. for lignocaine) associated with CNS and CVS toxicity."
- "Mention was also expected of the particular risks associated with the use of bupivacaine."
EC_extraCredit:
- "In addition to an outline of CNS and CVS toxicity good answers included some of the following: • A definition of \"toxicity\" (needle-induced nerve damage and CSF leak do not fall within any standard definition) • Kinetic factors influencing toxic plasma levels (e.g. dose, rate and site of administration, lipid solubility, protein binding, clearance) • Effects on toxicity of both acidosis and elevated PCO2 • Direct toxicity to nerves • Toxic effects at autonomic ganglia • Toxic effects at the neuromuscular junction • Special features of prilocaine • Special features of cocaine • Stereoisomers and the relevant features of ropivacaine and S and R bupivacaine • Toxicity in association with pregnancy • Toxicity in the foetus • Effects of additives (e.g. adrenaline, metabisulfite) • Effects of metabolites (e.g. of esters and of lignocaine) • Immune-based reactions"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A number of answers omitted any reference to CVS toxicity, and some made no reference to CNS toxicity. A few made no mention of either."
