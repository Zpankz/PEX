entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 1999
sitting: B
question: 16
passRate: 55
EC_expectedDomains:
- "An ideal answer would have considered the offset of infusion effects in terms of both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Kinetic parameters of importance include re-distribution and clearance. Pharmacodynamic effects would have led to a consideration of the interactions with other drugs."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good answers used several examples, the commonest used being propofol, remifentanil and non-depolarizing muscle relaxants."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "As always, it was disappointing to see that several candidates had failed to plan the examination, and had left little or no time to answer the final question."
- "Answers (and there were many) which concentrated purely on the issue of context-sensitive half time and remifentanil attested more to successful marketing by drug companies, rather than a clear understanding by candidates of the issues raised by this question."
