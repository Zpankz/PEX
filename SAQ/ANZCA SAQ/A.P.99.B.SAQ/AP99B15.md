EC_expectedDomains:
- "Preparation, physical properties and toxicity should all have been covered."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers covered the following points: Preparation 1. Fractional distillation of liquid air. Based on different boiling pints of oxygen and nitrogen. Used for commercial production. 2. Oxygen concentrators. Absorption of nitrogen by \"artificial zeolite\". Used for home use and remote locations. Physical properties • Colourless, odourless gas. • Molecular weight 32. • Critical temperature – 119oC. • Supports combustion. Potential adverse effects • Acute pulmonary toxicity, • absorption atelectasis, • decreased hypoxic respiratory drive in patients with hypercarbic respiratory failure, • retrolental fibroplasia, • hyperbaric effects including convulsions and pulmonary toxicity."
