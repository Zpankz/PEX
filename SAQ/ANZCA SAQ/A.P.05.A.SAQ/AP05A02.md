title: "Outline the acute adverse effects of opioid receptor agonists. Describe the mechanisms of the acute adverse effects of opioid receptor agonists."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2005
sitting: A
question: 2
passRate: 73
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points anticipated included dose-dependent depression of the brainstem respiratory centres, pronounced at the extremes of age, with initial reduced respiratory rate, and a reduction in the response of minute ventilation to increased pCO2 (right shift in the minute ventilation-pCO2 response curve) and decreased ventilatory response to hypoxia; nausea and vomiting with stimulation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone; effects on cognition and mood, including dysphoria and sedation; cardiovascular changes, particularly hypotension and/or bradycardia relating to histamine release, vagal stimulation, decreased central sympathetic outflow, baroreflex inhibition; effects on smooth muscle and sphincter tone resulting in delayed gastric emptying, ileus, constipation, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and urinary retention; chest wall skeletal muscle rigidity; and cutaneous effects including rash and pruritis."
- "Candidates were expected to have knowledge of the mechanisms by which opioids exerted their adverse effects, and lists of opioid receptor subtypes, without indication of location, were insufficient."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Marks were also awarded for additional effects or details, including, but not limited to, bronchospasm relating to histamine release, sleep apnoea, suppression of upper and lower airway reflexes including cough, delayed respiratory depression after intrathecal opioid administration, neurendocrine effects including increased ADH and other actions on the hypothalamic-hypophyseal system, specific actions of pethidine on the cardiovascular system, immune effects of opioids including viral reactivation; and anaphylactoid reactions. Other opioid actions, e.g. euphoria, meiosis, were accepted where candidates could indicate the manner in which such effects could be considered adverse."
- "Additional marks were awarded for clearly labelled graphs."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "No credit was given for adverse effects seen only after chronic use of opioids."
