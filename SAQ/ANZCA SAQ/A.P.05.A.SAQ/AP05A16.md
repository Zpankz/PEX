title: "Briefly explain the principles of Doppler ultrasound used to measure cardiac output."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2005
sitting: A
question: 16
passRate: 52
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Important points: Nature of ultrasound waves and working frequencies, Piezoelectric effect, Doppler effect, Doppler equation relating velocity and Doppler shift in frequency, Components of the Doppler equation, particularly the incident angle, Cardiac output measurement, Measurement of flow from cross sectional area and velocity, Integrated flow over time to give stroke volume, Heart rate, Advantages/disadvantages"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The most common mistake was to equate velocity or a single flow rate with cardiac output; not accounting for the pulsatile nature of cardiac output."
