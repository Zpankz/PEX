title: "Describe the compensatory mechanisms in a fit person moving from the supine to the standing position."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2005
sitting: A
question: 14
passRate: 52
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points that would gain a pass were: An appreciation that the circulation acts as a hydrostatic column of fluid subject to the effects of gravity, Descriptions of the main circulatory effects of becoming upright, Demonstration of an understanding of the circulatory compensation mechanisms involved, Reference to the important cerebral compensations, The contribution of the leg muscles and venous valves, An idea of the time course and sequence of these events"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional information that attracted further marks included: More detailed descriptions of the feedback mechanisms involved, Numerical quantifications of the magnitude of the various pressure changes, Identification of the conditions under which the physiological compensation mechanisms would be incomplete or disrupted, An understanding of the relationship of the changes on intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure and venous pressure"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common mistakes or omissions included: Confusion over whether a decrease in blood pressure increases or decreases the rate of firing from the baroreceptors, Pursuing one or two parameters in great detail, at the expense of a comprehensive overview, Reproduction of graphs or formulae that, although relevant, are not accompanied by any description of the physiological implications of the interrelationship, It should be noted that re-writing the question verbatim at the beginning of the answer does not attract marks"
