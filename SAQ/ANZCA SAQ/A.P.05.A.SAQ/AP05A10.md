title: "Write brief notes on the physiological changes associated with sleep."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2005
sitting: A
question: 10
passRate: 47
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question was best answered using a systems approach, following a brief definition of sleep."
- "Marks were allocated for a short description of the effects on the CNS, including the changes observed in the EEG."
- "The respiratory system should have included the effects on airway tone (particularly during REM sleep) and changes in arterial blood gases and the carbon dioxide/ventilation response curve."
- "Cardiovascular system effects include falls in heart rate and blood pressure, with variable effects on cardiac output, and these were generally recognised by candidates."
- "Effects on general skeletal muscle tone scored marks, especially when the differential effect of REM sleep was mentioned."
- "Marks were also allocated for brief mention of metabolic effects, including slight reduction in body temperature."
- "Marks were also gained for mention of hormonal effects, and there was often some confusion about the increased gastrointestinal motility occurring during sleep."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A distinction between slow-wave and REM sleep attracted extra marks."
- "The preponderance of parasympathetic over the sympathetic nervous system was often noted in the answers, and gained bonus marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates omitted these points, but mentioned effects on tidal volume. This area is covered well in Nunnâ€™s Applied Respiratory Physiology."
- "Common errors were a failure to mention significant areas, and incorrect effects of sleep on muscle tone."
