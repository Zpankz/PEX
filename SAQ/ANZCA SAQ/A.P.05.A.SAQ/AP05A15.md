title: "Discuss how the body handles a metabolic acidosis."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2005
sitting: A
question: 15
passRate: 38
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Main points for a pass: Metabolic acidosis definition and example of a cause, Description of rapidly acting mechanisms, Dilution/respiratory compensation/extracellular and intracellular buffers, Process of acid excretion, Renal excretion of acid load, Regeneration of bicarbonate, Formation of titratable acid, Ammonia/ammonium secretion and excretion"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were awarded for: Recognising that respiratory compensation will not excrete a metabolic acid, Recognition that free unbound hydrogen ions cannot be excreted, Aldosterone effect on hydrogen ion excretion, Role of urinary ketones in removing acid, Route of lactate oxidation and conversion to pyruvate, Value of ammonium excretion in removing acid, Specific details of ammonia/ammonium secretion and excretion with bicarbonate generation"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common omissions: Definition of metabolic acidosis, Importance of bone buffering, Listing, without explaining, how specific buffers function, The limitation of respiratory compensation in dealing with fixed acids, Explanation of the mechanism of bicarbonate reabsorption by the kidney"
- "Common mistakes: Use of abbreviations that were difficult to decipher, Repetition of the same point doesnâ€™t gain more marks, Inaccurate descriptions of the renal mechanisms of bicarbonate conservation and hydrogen ion secretion, Details of the physiological effects of acidosis on organ systems did not attract marks, Additional marks were not awarded for pH or buffer definitions"
