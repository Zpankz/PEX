title: "Outline the main biochemical events involved in noradrenergic transmission. Outline how these may be altered by the use of MAO (mono amine oxidase) inhibitors."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2005
sitting: A
question: 7
passRate: 67
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected for a pass were: A schematic outline of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) synthesis from phenylalanine via tyrosine, DOPA, and dopamine, naming enzymes involved and the locations of these reactions, Function of the storage vesicle plus the calcium dependent exocytosis following the action potential, The biochemical interaction of the norepinephrine and the receptor, Breakdown by COMT in cleft (also intracellular) and other organs to form normetanephrine, Reuptake of norepinephrine at presynaptic and postsynaptic locations, MAO action in nerve terminal or sympathetic varicosities followed by COMT action to 3-methoxy- 4-mandelic acid (VMA), Inhibition of MAO resulting in decreased metabolism and subsequent increased activity and potential enhanced availability of norepinephrine plus epinephrine (adrenaline) and serotonin, Biochemical sequences explaining the adverse events when indirect or direct acting sympathomimetics, pethidine and derivatives, tyramine containing foods, and serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, are administered in the presence of MAO inhibition"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Credit was given for: Mention of the MAO A and B sites along with their inhibitors, Noting of the reversibility of inhibition of MAO, Explanation of the role of false transmitters â€“ MAO-induced e.g. octopamine, Mention of the biochemical rationale for the therapeutic use of the MAOIs"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Receptor mechanisms and actions were outside the biochemical focus of this question."
