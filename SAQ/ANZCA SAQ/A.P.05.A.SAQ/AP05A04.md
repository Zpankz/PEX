title: "Outline the mechanisms of action of drugs that inhibit cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction giving examples."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2005
sitting: A
question: 4
passRate: 59
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected for a pass included: Depolarising neuromuscular blocking agents, example- Suxamethonium, mechanism of action, Non Depolarising neuromuscular blocking agents, example- Cisatracurium, mechanism of action, Example and mechanism of action of at least one other mechanism inhibiting cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction, such as: Deficiency blockade: Drugs inhibiting ACh synthesis or release, Desensitisation blockade: Drugs inhibiting ACh efficacy at the post-junctional receptor, Phase 2 blockade, Channel blockade"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were awarded for a full answer incorporating all of the above mechanisms with examples of drugs that have these effects."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common mistakes included drawing a diagram of a normal motor end plate, including a lengthy discussion of the normal physiology of excitation-contraction coupling, without incorporating relevance to the question of the mechanisms of drug action inhibiting cholinergic transmission."
- "Also, many candidates discussed mechanisms of action of drugs inhibiting cholinergic transmission, but did not provide examples of these drugs."
- "Finally, many candidates did not explain how suxamethonium-induced post-junctional receptor opening inhibited cholinergic transmission."
