title: "Describe the physiological factors influencing the carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2005
sitting: A
question: 12
passRate: 38
EC_expectedDomains:
- "In essence, arterial carbon dioxide tension is related to the balance of production and elimination of carbon dioxide, in a manner similar to drug levels as a result of the ratio of administration rate and clearance."
- "In addition, a system of CO2 sensors regulates elimination."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A minority of candidates discussed all three of these elements."
- "Areas such as changes in metabolic rate and changes in metabolic substrates do alter CO2 production, and description of these gained extra marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Despite the fact that this is an aspect of physiology which is fundamental to anaesthesia, in general this question was answered poorly."
- "CO2 production was often mentioned, but only some candidates described this is any detail."
- "When CO2 elimination was mentioned, it was often at a very basic level. Elimination is very dependant on issues such as dead space and V/Q inequality, and these were often not mentioned."
- "When they were included, there was sometimes confusion over the relative influences of diffusion vs. perfusion on CO2 exchange in the lung."
- "The feedback loop for the detection of CO2 tension and subsequent respiratory responses was often not mentioned. This is a key determinant of CO2 tension."
- "Many candidates spent a great deal of time, sometimes to the exclusion of almost everything else, on carbon dioxide carriage in the blood, phenomena such as the Haldane effect, and temperature/CO2 solubility. Whilst these have some impact to arterial CO2 tension, the effects are small compared to the factors mentioned above."
