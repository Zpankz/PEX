title: "Outline the effects of acute exposure to air at an altitude where barometric pressure is 347 mmHg. What compensatory mechanisms occur with gradual exposure to increasing altitude? (48.0%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2009
sitting: A
question: 16
passRate: 48
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Main Points expected for a pass: Definition of acute exposure Correct use of the alveolar gas equation to calculate PAO 2 How the body senses reduced oxygen levels and w hat compensatory mechanisms are triggered (esp. respiratory and cardiovascular) Some Mention of acute adverse effects Definition of “gradual exposure” Explanation of biphasic changes in alveolar minute ventilation Increased tissue oxygen uptake and utilisation Increased Hb and mechanism Mechanism s that act on moving the HbO DC"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional points could be gained for: Description of other effects at altitude – temperature, humidity, U V light, radiation. Upper limits of human survival Physiological differences between high-altitude and low -altitude natives Long term adaptation Changes at the cellular level"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many answ ers w ere w ritten linearly which did not allow coverage of the breadth of the topic There was significant confusion regarding the overall direction of m ovem ent of the HbO DC and the causes of biphasic changes in alveolar ventilation"
- "The main reason for failing this question was a lack of basic knowledge"
