title: "Explain the concept of Minimal Alveolar Concentration (MAC) and its clinical utility. LIST the patient factors which: a) Increase MAC b) Decrease MAC c) Are known to have no effect on MAC (82.0%)"

question: 01
passRate: 82
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Minimum Alveolar Concentration (MAC) is the alveolar concentration of an inhaled anaesthetic that prevents movement in 50% of patients in response to a standardized stimulus (e.g. surgical incision). It is a measure of relative potency and is used as a standard for experimental studies. There are other kinds of MAC value such as 'MAC awake,' when 50% of patients open their eyes on request. MAC values for different agents are approximately additive."
- "(a) Increases MAC: • hyperthermia • drugs that increase CNS catecholamines (such acute amphetamine ingestion)"
- "(b) Decreases MAC: • elderly • pregnancy • other anaesthetic agents (e.g. opioids, benzodiazepines) • acute ethanol ingestion"
- "(c) No change in MAC: • duration of anaesthesia • gender"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Chronic alcoholism either increases MAC or makes no difference, depending on the source consulted, therefore either statem ent gained credit. The effect of thyroid dysfunction is similarly controversial and was treated the sam e w ay."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Those who did poorly omitted any description of clinical utility or failed to list a few factors that affect (or do not affect) MAC."
