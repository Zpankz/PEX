title: "Outline the factors that determine the rate of recovery from non-depolarising neuromuscular block? (38.0%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2009
sitting: A
question: 03
passRate: 38
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Recovery from neuromuscular block is dependent on the competitive balance of ACh and nondepolarising blocking agent (NDBA) at the ACh receptor. After a single bolus of NDBA the offset is as a result of redistribution. O nly after repeat boluses or infusion does metabolism and excretion become significant."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The pharmacological properties of the drugs were generally well done as were the lists of physiological and drug interactions. Candidates who were able to give correct examples scored additional marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This important point was mentioned in only one paper. Most mentioned that recovery was slow er after large doses without further explanation. There was much confusion as to whether an increased volume of distribution resulted in an increased or decreased duration. This is dependent on whether the drug is administered as a single bolus."
- "The use of anticholinesterase agents and their effectiveness depending of the depth of block was seldom mentioned."
