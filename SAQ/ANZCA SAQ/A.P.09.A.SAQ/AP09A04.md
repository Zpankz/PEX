EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected for a pass included an outline of how these two anticholinergic drugs are similar and also how they differ. Descriptions of their chemical, pharmaceutic, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties in a table helped in answering the first question. O nce a difference between these agents had been outlined, it was expected that a discussion would ensue as to how that difference could influence your clinical use of these two alternative drugs."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The first question was w ell answered in general, but the commonest omission was to not answer the second question. W hen a difference between these agents was correctly identified, there was no discussion as to how that may affect clinical decision-making. Answ ering only half of the question prevents a candidate from scoring highly."
