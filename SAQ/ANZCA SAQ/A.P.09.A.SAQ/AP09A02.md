title: "Describe the factors which increase the risk of systemic toxicity with amide local anaesthetic agents. (31.0%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2009
sitting: A
question: 02
passRate: 31
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The answer should have been structured into pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors in order to make covering all aspects of the question easier. Factors expected included dose, site, vasoconstrictors, reduced protein binding, hepatic function, CVS:CNS ratios, patient factors (acidosis, ion trapping, altered seizure threshold, lowered CVS reserve), as well as age and pregnancy."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were awarded for additional detail or additional factors such as isomers, local anaesthetic specific features, active metabolites, and physicochemical features."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "There was confusion over changes related to pH and pKa. Acidosis increases the ionised fraction and the risk of toxicity and ion trapping. Many candidates spent a lot of time describing local anaesthetic toxicity without relating it to CVS:CNS ratios and neglected other aspects of the question."
- "Information pertaining to the general nature of ester and amide local anaesthetics, their structures, mechanism of action, the management of local anaesthetic toxicity, and Fick’s law of diffusion that did not relate directly to the question and generally didn’t attract marks."
