title: "Describe the physiological processes that influence the rate of gastric emptying. (56.0%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2009
sitting: A
question: 14
passRate: 56
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This meant candidates were able to cover the local, neural and hormonal control of the rate of gastric emptying."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were gained for an explanation of mechanism of action and the interrelationship between the controls."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common omissions included the reason why the rate is controlled, ie. allowing for adequate digestion time with gastric acid and enzymes before passing chyme through the pyloric sphincter, the importance of the “pyloric pump” and the negative feedback control of the duodenal sensors to ensure the adequacy of the digestive process."
- "Some candidates confused which hormones increased or decreased the rate of emptying, this detracted from their answers."
- "No marks were given for pharmacological manipulation of the rate of gastric emptying."
