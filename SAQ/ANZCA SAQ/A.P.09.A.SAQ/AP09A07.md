title: "Outline the subtypes of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) receptors. Discuss pharmacological agents that act at these sites. (45.0%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2009
sitting: A
question: 07
passRate: 45
EC_expectedDomains:
- "General description of location of receptors as found in Central nervous system (CNS), Peripheral nervous system (PNS), on vascular smooth muscle and platelets."
- "Statement that 5-HT receptors are G -protein coupled except for the 5HT3 subtype which is a ligand-gated ion channel."
- "An attempt at numbering the quantity of subtypes, some texts differ between 4-5 or 7 subtypes."
- "Correctly describing some agonists at the individual subtypes."
- "Correctly describing some antagonists at the individual subtypes."
- "Including commonly used drugs such as ondansetron and correctly identifying the pharmacological action as an antagonist at the 5 HT-3 receptor, also Tramadol and its indirect method of action on the receptors as a 5HT uptake inhibitor"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Identifying the numbers of subtypes within the receptor fam ilies, for example, 5HT-1 type D receptors, 5HT-2 A,B and C subtypes"
- "Individually addressing the receptor subtypes, sumatriptan and its use in the treatment of migraine as well as the mechanism of action"
- "Descriptions of Metoclopramide as a 5HT-4 agonist and its pharmacological action & site of 5HT-4 receptors"
- "Mention of 5HT-2 receptors and antagonists, such as ketanserin, m methysergide, pizotifen or cyproheptadine."
- "Extra credit for mentioning less well known agents, for example, know ing LSD is an agonist at the 5HT receptor, as well as buspirone or tegaserod."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Incorrectly identifying all 5HT receptors as G -protein coupled or misidentifying which sub-type is ligand-gated"
- "Incorrectly stating that drugs are agonists, when they are antagonists and vice-versa"
- "Failing to describe the activity of the drug at the receptor"
- "Confusing the mode of action and the receptor activity, for example, claim ing 5HT-1 agonists like sumatriptan cause cerebral vasodilatation when they cause vasoconstriction."
