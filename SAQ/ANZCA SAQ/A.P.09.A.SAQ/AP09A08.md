title: "What is meant by the term “95% confidence interval”? Explain the practical applications of confidence intervals and indicate why they may be preferred to p-values. (20.5%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2009
sitting: A
question: 08
passRate: 20
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Any 95% CI gives a 95% probability that the true population parameter will be found within that interval. It is a range of values that give a likelihood that the population parameter being studied will be found within them . Contrary to w hat many candidates stated, it does not mean that 95% of observations are contained within 1.96 standard deviation."
- "95% CI is derived from the Standard Error and hence is dependent on sample size. To attain a pass in this question, candidates needed to present a clear definition of the 95% CI as a concept, present an understanding of how it is calculated w ith clear understanding of the determinants of 95% CI and demonstrate a good understanding of the relationship and the difference betw een 95% CI and P value and its advantages over the p value."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates w ho demonstrate practical applications of CI and/or other form s of CI achieved bonus marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates presented a definition of the 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) but failed to demonstrate an understanding of the concept. Many candidates presented unnecessary details of how to design a clinical trial or conducted multiple comparisons with drug interventions without demonstrating the utility of 95% CI. There was significant confusion between standard deviation and standard error of the m ean w ith m any candidates using them interchangeably without any qualification."
