title: "Discuss the physiological factors that determine intracranial pressure (ICP), and describe how changes in posture affect ICP. (57.0%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2009
sitting: A
question: 09
passRate: 57
EC_expectedDomains:
- "In general the candidates answered this question well, based on the Monro-Kellie doctrine. The answer should have included: 1) Some introductory definition of intracranial pressure, normal values, and the Monro-Kellie framework. 2) The effects and causes of changes in intracranial blood volume, tissue volume, and CSF production circulation and re-absorption. 3) A discussion of how supine, erect, and Trendelenburg positions might alter CSF and blood dynamics."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks w ere aw arded for graphs of changes in ICP with intracranial volume, and the relationship between CSF absorption, production and ICP."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates spent a lot of time explaining cerebral blood flow and cardiovascular responses to change in posture that were not directly relevant to the question. It was also common for candidates to erroneously re-arrange various equations (e.g. ICP = MAP * CPP, or even ICP = CBF/CVResistance); and use these as bases for the answer, rather than discussing real physiological cause and effect."
