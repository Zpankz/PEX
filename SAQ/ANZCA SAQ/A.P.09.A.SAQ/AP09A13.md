title: "What is the Frank-Starling mechanism and describe its relationship to excitation contraction coupling (21.0%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2009
sitting: A
question: 13
passRate: 21
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Main points expected for a pass included:  • definition and graphical representation (with alternative axes) of Frank Starling law;  • a statement of the concept of this being an intrinsic ability of the heart to adapt to increasing volumes of venous return;  • optimal length of sarcomere; and,  • demonstration of sliding filament theory and effect of initial fibre length on actin-myosin cross-bridging."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were allocated for mention of:  • there being a family of curves;  • increased calcium sensitivity of stretched me filaments; • questionable effect of excessive stretching in cardiac muscle; and,  • effect of increased afterload or decreased heart rate upon myocardial stretch and response."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Mistakes commonly made included:  • misinterpreting the question and giving irrelevant detail regarding action potential transmission and calcium release within the myofibril;  • using the terms contractility and force of contraction interchangeably; and,  • poor legibility of key words."
- "Credit was not given for vague, non-directional statements of effect of muscle length, nor for statement that stretch causes increased release of calcium."
