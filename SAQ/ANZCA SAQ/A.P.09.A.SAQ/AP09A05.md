title: "Outline the effects of an opioid injected into the spinal intrathecal space. (39.0%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2009
sitting: A
question: 05
passRate: 39
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected for a pass include: the fate of the intrathecal opioid i.e. passage across the meninges to exert its action on spinal cord opioid receptors, some cephalad spread in the CSF to supraspinal centres and minimal systemic absorption to exert systemic effects."
- "The main effect is segmental analgesia, with little motor or sympathetic effects. Some appreciation that the extent of distribution is determined by lipid solubility of the agent and that most of the effect of the opioid is due to its action on the spinal cord."
- "The major side effects of intrathecal opioids i.e. pruritus, respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, including mechanism of action. Other side effects of opioids are negligible."
- "More detail was expected on respiratory depression, given its clinical importance. Early respiratory depression is more likely amongst the lipophilic opioids eg fentanyl. Late depression is more likely with hydrophilic agents such as morphine as it is bound less to the spinal cord and so is carried in the CSF to respiratory centres in the brain."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Points were awarded for mentioning which opioids are commonly used intrathecally, in what doses and their onset and duration of action."
- "Bonus marks were allocated for: Statements about the low dose of intrathecal as compared to intravenous or epidural opioids, showing understanding of the fate of intrathecal opioids, synergism with local anaesthetics, neurotoxic additives which render certain opioids unsuitable for intrathecal use, development of tolerance, other less common side effects."
