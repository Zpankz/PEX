title: "Outline the determinants and regulation of extracellular fluid volume. (53.0%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2009
sitting: A
question: 11
passRate: 53
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected in answering the question include • a definition of ECF volume as volume of fluid outside cells, including plasma and interstitial volumes  • recognition of the importance of Na+ as the major extracellular cation, and that the amount of Na+ in the ECF is the most important determinant of ECF volume  • better answers highlighted the im portant mechanism s controlling Na+ balance as the major factors regulating ECF volume  • aldosterone is the most important single controller of Na+ balance; outlining functional control, stimuli for release including the renin-angiotensin system , and effects were expected  • a more comprehensive answer included outlining renal water balance via antidiuretic hormone(ADH), and the effect of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on Na+ balance"
EC_extraCredit:
- "extra marks w ere aw arded for clarifying the tension existing between ECF regulation and water regulation (ECF volume v osmolarity)"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "a common mistake was to concentrate on Starling Forces and the Gibbs-Donnan Effect without mention of Na+ or water balance"
