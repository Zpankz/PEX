title: "Describe the formation, fate and role of lactate in energy production. (19.0%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2009
sitting: A
question: 15
passRate: 19
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Lactate is form ed form pyruvate allowing the regeneration of NAD + from NADH which is necessary for the Embden-Meyerhof pathway to proceed in anaerobic conditions or in cells without mitochondria. Lactate diffuses out of the cells and is either used by the heart as an energy substrate or metabolised in the liver to glucose."
- "Further details required to pass this question included: • Some description of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway and the fates of pyruvate, however a detailed description of each intermediary was not necessary. • An understanding of the cause of the normal serum lactate of 0.5-2.0 mmol/L • Details of the Cori Cycle"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Hence candidates should have a good understanding of its role in energy production so that they can interpret this indicator in clinical situations."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Few candidates could describe the role of lactate in energy production. Most attempted to describe the glycolytic pathway but often with significant errors. The fate of lactate was again only covered correctly by a few candidates. Many candidates gave lengthy answers addressing exercise and oxygen debt which was not a key part of the question."
