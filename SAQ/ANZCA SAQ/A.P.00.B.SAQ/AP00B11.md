title: "Describe the structure and function of G proteins."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2000
sitting: B
question: 11
passRate: 50
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Otherwise the heterotrimeric structure of the G protein and the sequence of events from activation of the receptor to activation of the effector mechanism was well described. Most candidates knew that G proteins are responsible for transduction and amplification of the original signal but very few mentioned how changes in G protein coupling are involved in the regulation of receptors."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers were able to give several examples of G protein linked receptors along with the corresponding enzyme systems or ion channels that were the effectors for the different G proteins (e.g. β adrenoreceptor linked to Gs to stimulate adenylyl cyclase to increase cAMP; μ opioid receptor linked to an inhibitory G protein that opens K+ channels, etc.)."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "G proteins are so named because they are guanine nucleotide binding proteins (and thus bind GDP and GTP, not ADP and ATP as suggested by some candidates). The most common error was to confuse the structure of the G protein with that of the receptor to which the G protein is coupled. Some candidates mistakenly referred to the G protein itself as the second messenger. Many candidates gave unnecessary information on the structure of the G protein linked receptor itself or wasted time describing a long cascade of effects caused by different second messengers."
