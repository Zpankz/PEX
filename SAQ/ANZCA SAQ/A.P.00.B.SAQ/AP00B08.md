title: "Describe the factors governing glomerular filtration rate."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2000
sitting: B
question: 08
passRate: 52
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points could be covered by a description of the following equation: GFR = Kf[(PGC - PT) - σ( ΠGC- ΠT)] where Kf = glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient, PGC = capillary hydrostatic pressure, PT = tubular hydrostatic pressure , ΠGC = plasma osmotic pressure, ΠT = tubular osmotic pressure, σ = reflection coefficient. A short description of how each of these factors affected GFR was required. A description of Kf, was expected; i.e. the product of the glomerular capillary wall hydraulic conductivity (its permeability) and the effective filtration area."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for stating normal values, and for more detail on how GFR is affected by: Changes in blood pressure; autoregulation, Tubuloglomerular feedback, Changes in the afferent and efferent arteriolar vascular tone of the glomerular capillaries, Factors affecting afferent and efferent arteriolar vascular tone, Changes in hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's capsule, Effects of oedema within renal capsule, Changes in plasma protein concentration, Permeability of glomerular capillaries in pathological states"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The major errors or omissions were to \"list\" rather than \"describe\" factors affecting GFR, and to not state the direction in which GFR was affected, i.e. an increase or a decrease."
