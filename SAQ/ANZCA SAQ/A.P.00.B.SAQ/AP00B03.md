EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question asked for a diagram of a forced expiratory flow volume curve and it was expected that this would be done reasonably accurately with correctly labelled axes and values. It was also expected that the candidate would draw the patterns in obstructive and restrictive lung diseases and describe the characteristics in these conditions."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for description of the effort dependent and independent portions of the curve, as well as for some explanation about effort dependent and independent flow."
