title: "Outline the principles of compatibility testing of allogeneic (homologous) blood for transfusions."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2000
sitting: B
question: 04
passRate: 27
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Principles of compatibility testing requires: Blood grouping. Determination of the recipient's blood group for ABO and Rh antigens. This is achieved by adding a reagent known to contain a specific antibody and observing for agglutination, Screening for the presence of antibodies in the recipient to other red cell antigens. This is achieved by adding a panel of red cells of the same ABO and Rh group, which are known to express other antigens, and observing for agglutination., Selection of a probably compatible unit grouped by techniques as described above., Crossmatching: Mixing a sample of the potential donor red blood cells from this unit with the recipientâ€™s serum and observing for agglutination:"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for information on IgM/IgG (and the difference in techniques for detection), the importance of attention to patient and sample identification, and why some antigen:antibody reactions are more important than others."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common mistakes were to confuse or misuse the following terms: Haemolysis and haemagglutination, Autologous and homologous, Direct and indirect Coombs test, Haemolysis and anaphylaxis, Universal Donor, IgM and IgG antibodies, Immediate and delayed transfusion reactions. A common incorrect statement was that group O red blood cells have no antigens. Several candidates stated that 98% compatibility could be achieved using an abbreviated (and cheaper) testing procedure. While this may be true, it is important to state that a 2% incompatibility rate is unacceptable. 12 candidates wrote on autologous not allogeneic transfusion."
