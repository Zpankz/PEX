title: "Compare and contrast the pharmacology of atracurium and cis- atracurium."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2000
sitting: B
question: 16
passRate: 26
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question was best answered in tabular form using a standard pharmacological approach starting with physicochemistry and moving to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "It was incorrect to write that cisatracurium is the cis isomer of atracurium. Atracurium is a mixture of 10 isomers, 15% by weight being cisatracurium which provides 50% of the relaxant activity. Cisatracurium is the R-cis, R'-cis isomer, where R designates the stereochemistry of the tetrahydropapaverine rings and cis represents the dimethoxy and 2 alkyl ester groups at C1 and N2. Pharmacokinetic parameters were poorly presented and many answers stated incorrectly that the drugs have identical kinetics. The effects of age, temperature, pH and advanced liver and renal failure were rarely presented. Metabolic pathways of cisatracurium were a source of confusion in many answers. Cisatracurium is 77% metabolised by Hoffman elimination, with 16% cleared by the kidneys. Atracurium is mainly metabolized by ester hydrolysis. The drugs are not pharmacodynamically similar and it is important to compare the two drugs at ED95 equivalent doses. In fact ED95, duration of action, and recovery times from bolus and infusion regimens were rarely mentioned."
