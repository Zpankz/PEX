entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2000
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 79
EC_expectedDomains:
- "While possible to classify diuretics in a ‘uniform way’ by their site of action (action on proximal tubule, loop of Henle, etc.) or mechanism (osmotic, inhibitor of ion exchange, etc.), the majority of standard texts use a mixture of these. Thus acceptable answers for this question could include any of the above, as long as all major types of diuretics were mentioned. The commonest classifications used were: action in proximal tubule (carbonic anhydrase inhibitor); loop of Henle (loop diuretics); distal tubule (thiazide compounds); collecting ducts (potassium ‘sparing’ agents); osmotic agents. A specific example was expected for each of the other ‘major’ classes (e.g. acetazolamide, frusemide, chlorothiazide, spironolactone, mannitol). A brief but clear explanation of the mechanism of action was expected."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Mention of diuresis secondary to increases in cardiac output, renal blood flow and glomerular filtration, or to antagonism of the effects of antidiuretic hormone, also received credit."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "It was commonly assumed that a description of altered ion flux alone was an explanation of diuresis. This was particularly apparent in descriptions of inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Few answers mentioned the effect of osmotic diuretics on the renal medulla’s concentration gradient or the difference between the site of action of spironolactone and other potassium sparing diuretics such as triamterene. Details of the therapeutic uses of diuretics gained no credit."
