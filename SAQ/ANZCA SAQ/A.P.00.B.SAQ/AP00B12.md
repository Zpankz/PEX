EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was not sufficient to list the pharmacokinetic parameters of these two drugs without reference to the core of the question, which was to explain how these characteristics influence the way the drugs are administered intravenously. Relative comparisons of the pharmacokinetic values were satisfactory and given the same credence as exact kinetic values."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Marks were given for a description of how data such as pKa, lipid solubility, protein binding, volume of distribution and clearance influenced the drugsâ€™ relative potency, onset, and duration of action. The time to peak effect and context sensitive half time of the two drugs could also be compared. All these factors in turn could influence the choice of drug, timing of administration, dose, dosing intervals and dosing regimens that are used in clinical practice."
