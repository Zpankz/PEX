title: "Explain the role of haemoglobin as a buffer."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2003
sitting: A
question: 9
passRate: 38
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A definition of a buffer was required, and also that buffering capacity or effectiveness depends on the concentration of the buffer relative to the ambient pH of the solution."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers mentioned the fact that the bicarbonate buffer system cannot buffer carbonic acid (CO2) as they form part of the same weak acid – conjugate base pair."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates incorrectly stated that haemoglobin functioned as a buffer by the formation of carbamino compounds."
- "This information was deficient in most answers."
- "The dissociation of carbamino compounds within the erythrocyte actually adds hydrogen ions that need to be buffered by haemoglobin and other buffers."
- "Haemoglobin, although intracellular (within the erythrocyte), functions mainly as an “extracellular” buffer for CO2 (volatile acid) formed from aerobic metabolism. The solubility of CO2, the presence of carbonic anhydrase within the erythrocyte and the buffering capacity of haemoglobin all contribute to make the haemoglobin buffering system extremely efficient."
- "Haemoglobin is a quantitatively important buffer because there is a large amount present in blood – 150gm/L. Also the imidazole groups of the histidine residues of the globin chains are an effective buffer as their pKa of 6.8 is close to the pH within the erythrocyte. The buffering capacity of haemoglobin is greatest when it is needed most, that is when haemoglobin is deoxygenated in venous blood with a higher CO2 content. Deoxygenated haemoglobin is a better buffer than oxyhaemoglobin as it is a weaker acid, and the pKa of its imidazole groups are higher at 7.9. The increased buffering capacity of deoxygenated haemoglobin contributes approximately 30% of the Haldane effect."
