EC_expectedDomains:
- "Most candidates demonstrated a good understanding of the principles of the device and the strengths and weaknesses in detection of systolic, diastolic and mean pressures."
EC_extraCredit: []
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some candidates presented their answer as if this device was synonymous with a particular brand. It is very reasonable to present the specifications of a particular brand as an example of such a device but not to imply that there is only one type."
- "Some descriptions of the equipment were problematic."
- "The concept of the bladder within the cuff was often not clear and lead to confusion about describing the positioning and size of the bladder."
- "Descriptions of the recommended dimensions of the cuff (and bladder) often did not specify whether length or width were being presented."
- "There were some instances of confusion between historical two tube and two cuff equipment (particularly oscillotonometry cf oscillometry) and current single cuff and tube equipment."
- "Occasional candidates also confused detection of oscillations with detection of Korotkoff sounds."
- "Modern oscillometry devices have the transducer in the control box not in the cuff."
- "Formulas presented for calculating the diastolic pressure were often presented as variations of Mean Arterial Pressure = Diastolic Arterial Pressure + 1/3 pulse pressure. These were usually technically correct but would be better presented as Diastolic Arterial Pressure = a formula related to directly measured parameters (or other algorithm related to change in percentage size of oscillations detected)."
