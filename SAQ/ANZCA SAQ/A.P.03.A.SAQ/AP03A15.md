title: "Describe the physiological actions of thyroid hormones."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2003
sitting: A
question: 15
passRate: 38
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question asked the physiological actions of thyroid hormones, not the synthesis of thyroid hormones."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Marks were awarded for noting the forms of thyroid hormones, the relative amounts in the bloodstream and relative activities."
- "An account of their mechanism of action at a cellular level was considered important."
- "An understanding of the implication of this mechanism of action to the time for onset of action and duration of effect scored extra marks."
- "An account of end-organ effects was present in some form in most answers, with a system by system approach often used."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some candidates spent time detailing their synthesis"
- "Most candidates were able to state that thyroid hormone increases metabolic rate. Many of these were able to go on to state that thyroid hormone had some catabolic effects. Some briefly mentioned the role of thyroid hormone in growth and development. Few picked up on the apparent contradiction between catabolic and anabolic effects, and described that the effects of thyroid hormones can be dose and age dependent. The effect of thyroid hormone to provide a negative feedback on its own synthesis was not often mentioned."
