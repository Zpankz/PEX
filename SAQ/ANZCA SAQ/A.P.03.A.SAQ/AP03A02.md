EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question was asked in appreciably the same format on the March 1999 paper."
- "The marking parameters as set out in that Examiner’s Report were still appropriate for this sitting."
- "Candidates are directed to read that Examiner’s Report."
- "Virtually all candidates appreciated the question had four sub-sections and ensured that they answered all four sections."
EC_extraCredit: []
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Despite the question specifying that only the four sections needed to be answered many candidates gave detailed, additional information on packaging, dosing and the structure of thiopentone without in any way attempting to relate these facts to the question asked. No credit was given for this."
- "Also vague answers such as “EEG changes are dose related” or “thiopentone has an inhibitory affect on the brain via GABA receptors” were deemed inadequate to answer the question satisfactorily without more detailed explanation."
