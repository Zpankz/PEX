title: "Explain how differences in the pharmacokinetics of alfentanil and fentanyl can influence the way they are administered intravenously."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2003
sitting: A
question: 6
passRate: 51
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to provide a pharmacokinetic explanation to the differences in the way fentanyl and alfentanil behave when given intravenously."
- "The differences in onset time, effect site equilibration, pka and diffusible fraction should have been discussed."
- "The differences in offset time (bolus and infusion), context sensitive half time and the kinetics underlying this should have been outlined."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates who provided representative figures on kinetics with their answer and made comments on administration of a single small dose bolus, high dose, repeated bolus and infusion gained extra marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates presented a comparative table of kinetic data of both drugs without any further explanation."
- "Similarly, many candidates presented context sensitive half- time graphs with inaccurate indication of the behaviour of the two drugs."
