title: "Explain how lignocaine prevents the conduction of a nerve action potential."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2003
sitting: A
question: 3
passRate: 37
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The content areas where marks were available could be split as follows: a) How lignocaine reached the site of action which might include differences between routes of delivery, nerve sites (e.g. peripheral vs. intrathecal), pH/pKa/ionisation relationships and principles of diffusion. b) Details of voltage gated sodium channel binding site and function, and lignocaineâ€™s interaction with it. c) Channels/nodes blocked to prevent action potential propagation. Differential nerve fibre block and why it occurs"
EC_extraCredit: []
EC_errorsCommon:
- "An almost universal belief that only ionised axoplasmic lignocaine gains access to the channel (refer Miller 5th Ed: Ch 13, Cousins & Bridenbaugh 3rd Ed: Ch 2, Rang, Dale & Ritter 4th Ed: Ch 40)."
- "The relationship between pH/pKa/drug ionisation with some candidates producing correct diagrams but incorrectly interpreting them, suggesting rote learning but a lack of understanding."
- "Lignocaine binding to the various channel states."
- "Unlabelled/inaccurate time axes on action potential diagrams."
- "A small, but significant, group stated that lignocaine primarily acted at ligand gated sodium channels in synapses. Candidates who included correct material on anti-arrhythmic and toxic effects of lignocaine gained no extra marks because the material was not relevant to the question asked."
