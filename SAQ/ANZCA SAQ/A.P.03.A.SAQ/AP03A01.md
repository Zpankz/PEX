title: "Briefly outline the effects of isoflurane on skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscle tissues. Indicate how these effects are mediated and their clinical significance."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2003
sitting: A
question: 1
passRate: 74
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Knowledge of the potential pharmacological and pathological actions of isoflurane on each type of muscle, the clinical significance and a general concept of the postulated mechanisms of action was expected."
- "Candidates were required to know that isoflurane causes dose-dependent skeletal muscle relaxation and potentiation of neuromuscular blockers, with increased skeletal muscle blood flow and drug delivery."
- "The relaxant effects of isoflurane on vascular smooth muscle including coronary and cerebral circulations and the actions on bronchial, pulmonary and uterine smooth muscle should have been considered."
- "Actions on cardiac contractility and conduction should have been included."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Possible mechanisms of action including CNS effects, postjunctional effects, effects on calcium channels and intracellular calcium, atypical ryanodine receptors in MH, nitric oxide production and G- protein linked receptors were often not outlined."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many answers were borderline and few candidates (<10%) provided a clear well-considered answer directly addressing all aspects of the question."
- "Many were unclear of the mechanism of coronary steal and of the controversy over its clinical significance."
