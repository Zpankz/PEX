title: "Outline the important statistical issues in designing a study to compare the duration of analgesia of two drugs given for post-operative pain relief."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2003
sitting: A
question: 5
passRate: 38
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The principal points expected to pass would have included the following: The setting of the study should be a randomised controlled clinical trial. A statement defining the Null Hypothesis to answer the question raised, for example that the drug has no significant effect on post-operative duration of pain relief. Discussion regarding the appropriate determination of sample size including power analysis and the setting of threshold for type one and two error. The surgical procedure and anaesthetic technique must be standardised to reduce bias. Other methods to reduce bias include blinding the person responsible for data collection. The definitions of inclusion criteria for endpoints of analgesic effect are important and pain severity scores were mentioned by many candidates."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Higher marks were given to answers which addressed which statistical test would be suitable and the reasons why it would be appropriate."
- "Other tests were acceptable provided potential limitations were identified and data suitability was included."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Power is only one of the issues in sample size estimation and a common mistake was to give too much emphasis to this point in candidateâ€™s answers."
- "The data may not be normally distributed so a non parametric test such as a Mann- Whitney U test might be preferred."
