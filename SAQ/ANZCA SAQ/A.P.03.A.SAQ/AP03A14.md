title: "Describe the factors that affect lung compliance."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2003
sitting: A
question: 14
passRate: 39
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Marks were allocated for: • A value with the correct units • The compliance equation relating the total lung, to chest wall and lung compliance. • Surfactant and its role on surface tension. • Laplace’s law and its applicability. • The importance of elastic forces and their role in disease states. • Lung size. • Lung volume and its relationship (to FRC) on compliance. • Effect of gravity on the lung and hence on compliance."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Mention of various compliances like dynamic, static and specific with their definitions attracted extra marks as did diagrams showing a pressure volume loop, hysteresis, or a compliance curve, with explanations."
- "Clinical relevance is also important and mention of restrictive lung disease, obstructive lung disease: pulmonary emphysema, pleural effusions, or at least some of those was appropriate."
- "Differentiating the effects of emphysema on dynamic vs. static compliance also attracted extra marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Irrelevancies were uncommon on this occasion, however some basic mistakes and omissions did occur."
- "The answer is best introduced with a definition."
