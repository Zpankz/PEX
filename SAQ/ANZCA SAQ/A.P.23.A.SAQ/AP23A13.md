title: "Briefly outline the production, metabolism, and role of lactate."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2023
sitting: A
question: 13
passRate: 23
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Production
◦ The production of lactate occurs normally in the body. This accounts for the normal plasma level of approximately 1 mmol/L.
◦ Brief explanation of the glycolytic pathway yielding pyruvate (and NADH). Pyruvate either enters the TCA cycle or is converted to lactate."
- "Metabolism
◦ Lactate can be converted back to pyruvate in any tissue with lactate dehydrogenase.
◦ A description of the Cori cycle was expected."
- "Roles
◦ Facilitate ongoing glycolysis by regeneration of NAD+ from NADH.
◦ Allow ongoing ATP generation in peripheral tissues when the TCA cycle cannot accept all the pyruvate (e.g. low O2 or excessive production) by offloading some of the metabolic work to the liver (Cori cycle). This is essential during exercise.
◦ Allow ongoing ATP generation in tissues which lack mitochondria (e.g. red cells)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Recognising that glycolysis is an anaerobic metabolic process that occurs throughout the body all the time, and exclusively so in some tissues."
- "Causes of increased lactate – increased production (e.g. adrenaline, exercise); or decreased clearance (e.g. liver impairment). Tissue hypoxia falls under both headings."
- "Understanding the “lactate sink”, and oxygen debt."
- "Quantifying numbers for ATP and NAD+ production."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Assuming that the presence of lactate is always pathological."
- "Focusing on lactate only as a “marker of ischaemia”."
- "Confusing the terms “anaerobic” and “hypoxic”."
- "Incorrect use of the terms glycolysis, gluconeogenesis (also glycogenesis, glycogenolysis)"
- "Incorrect or incomplete understanding of the Cori cycle. It is not solely the process of gluconeogenesis in the liver, but is a cycle between peripheral tissue (muscle) and the liver."
- "Confusing lactate with ketones."
- "Focusing on the causes or effects of metabolic acidosis."
- "Vague or incorrect biochemical statements (e.g. regarding “bicarbonate formation”)."
- "The roles of lactate were frequently omitted."
