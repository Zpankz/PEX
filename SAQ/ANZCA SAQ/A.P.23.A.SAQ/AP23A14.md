title: "a) Draw and label a central venous pressure (CVP) trace. Include on your diagram where ventricular systole and diastole occur. b) Explain the physiological basis for each component of the pressure waveform"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2023
sitting: A
question: 14
passRate: 48
EC_expectedDomains:
- "CVP waveform drawn accurately, using labelled axes."
- "Systole and diastole accurately marked."
- "Physiological basis of each component of the waveform."
EC_extraCredit:
- "More detail about the physiology of the waveform."
- "Including the phases of systole and diastole."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Poorly drawn waveform - sometimes bearing no resemblance to the true waveform (either as shown in textbooks or on a monitor screen)."
- "Systole and diastole labelled incorrectly, or so vaguely that it was not possible to interpret where the candidate meant the intervals to be."
- "Inadequate description of the underlying physiology."
- "Normal value (or range) omitted from y axis."
