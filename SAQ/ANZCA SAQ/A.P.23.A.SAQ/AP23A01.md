title: "List the potential adverse effects of opioids. Briefly outline the mechanisms of each adverse effect."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2023
sitting: A
question: 1
passRate: 59
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A reasonable list of ADVERSE effects of opioids preferably with emphasis on those most clinically relevant. It was anticipated that this would include respiratory and CNS effects. A body systems approach provided the structure for a good answer."
- "Physiological mechanisms that explain each of the adverse effects listed."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Breadth of answer, covering multiple systems."
- "Stating the anatomical location and subtypes of opioid receptors for the different adverse effects. However, listing these without describing a mechanism was not sufficient. (It is recognized that opioid receptor subtypes are variably assigned particular effects in different source texts.)"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "No discussion of CNS or respiratory adverse effects."
- "Just listing opioid receptor subtypes, rather than describing mechanisms."
- "Imprecise terminology."
