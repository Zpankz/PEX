title: "Compare and contrast the effects of general and neuraxial anaesthesia on thermoregulation."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2023
sitting: A
question: 12
passRate: 52
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Tri-phasic temperature decline (GA vs spinal)"
- "Reasons for differences in above graph (GA vs spinal)
◦ mechanisms of heat loss
◦ how thermoregulation is impaired"
EC_extraCredit:
- "More detail about mechanisms."
- "Describing the effect of a combined GA + neuraxial."
- "Including differences between epidural and spinal."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Listing definitions, without answering the question."
- "Listing all the thermoregulation mechanisms without specifying how these change under general or neuraxial anaesthesia."
- "Drawing graphs with unlabelled axes."
- "Confusing thermoneutral zone with interthreshold range."
