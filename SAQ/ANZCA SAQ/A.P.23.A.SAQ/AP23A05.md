EC_expectedDomains:
- "Classification of drugs used to treat bronchospasm, with examples. At least four drug classes were expected."
- "Mechanisms of action."
- "Side effects."
EC_extraCredit:
- "More detail (e.g. additional drug classes, more detailed mechanisms, or more side effects)."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The question specifically asked for drugs which could be used during a general anaesthetic. Therefore, oral medications and ‘preventer’ inhalers scored no marks."
- "A nebuliser is not suitable for use with a circle breathing system. It will dilute the inhaled volatile concentration, and cause erroneous volume and flow measurements. This is different from an ICU ventilator."
- "Steroids were frequently omitted."
- "Some candidates described the use of muscle relaxants to treat bronchospasm. Whilst these may improve IPPV by paralysing the diaphragm and abdominal muscles, they do not have any effect on smooth muscle."
- "A small number of candidates included the management of laryngospasm."
- "Salbutamol or adrenaline were described as antagonists, or acting via Gi/Gq GPCR."
