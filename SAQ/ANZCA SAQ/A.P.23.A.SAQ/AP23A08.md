EC_expectedDomains:
- "Circle breathing system accurately drawn and labelled."
- "Definition and description of “apparatus dead space”"
- "Functions and position of APL valve.
◦ APL valve functions include – allow escape of gas from the circuit (note that FGF is being added continually); control circuit pressure – to enable manual ventilation and/or PEEP; limit maximum pressure able to be generated; point of attachment of scavenging; not permit entrainment of room air; perform a circuit leak test. Note that the manual APL valve has no function at all when the ventilator is in use.
◦ Eger’s rules form part of the justification for the APL valve position."
EC_extraCredit:
- "More detail."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many diagrams contained serious errors or omissions, reflecting poor understanding of the equipment used by anaesthetists daily."
- "Many candidates could not define apparatus dead space correctly, and included vast sections of the circle breathing system within the definition of apparatus dead space."
- "The manual APL valve has no function at all when the ventilator is in use. Many diagrams did not reflect this. The ventilator has its own, electronically controlled APL valve equivalent."
- "The APL valve only protects against barotrauma when it is set within a clinically appropriate range. At its maximum setting, the APL valve will not open until 70 cmH2O is reached."
- "The reasons that the APL valve is on the expiratory side, and not on the inspiratory side, were poorly understood."
