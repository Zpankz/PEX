title: "a) Briefly outline how body tissue composition is progressively altered by morbid obesity. b) Define each of the following terms: • total body weight (TBW) • ideal body weight (IBW) • adjusted body weight (ABW) • lean body mass (LBM) c) Briefly comment on the suitability of each of the above terms when used as a scalar for estimating an INDUCTION dose of propofol in a morbidly obese patient."

EC_expectedDomains:
- "Body composition changes in morbid obesity.
◦ including the relative and absolute changes in lean and adipose mass, and how this alters the size of the central compartment"
- "Definitions of terms.
◦ including TBW, IBW, LBM (ABW not needed to pass)
◦ precise formulae were not needed to pass"
- "Suitability as dosing scalar.
◦ recognise the link between the size of the central compartment (V1) as the Vd(initial) when calculating a loading dose
◦ show how the changes seen in morbid obesity (mostly relating to effect on V1) affect the accuracy of scalars incorporating the TBW, IBW, LBM, ABW
◦ state why TBW would likely result in over-dose, and IBW in an under-dose
◦ state why LBM (or ABW) are better scalars"
EC_extraCredit:
- "quantifying the changes in body composition to the severity or class of obesity"
- "including correct equations"
- "including the effect of propofol distribution from V1 to V2 after a bolus"
- "discussing ABW"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "linking the changes in Vd(initial) to the fat mass rather than lean mass"
- "not understanding that lean tissue and blood volume are increased in obesity"
- "not understanding that 5% (or less) of the cardiac output goes to fat"
- "claiming that TBW or IBW are the best choice for calculating an induction dose (or claiming that LBM would under-dose)"
- "drawing the 3 compartment model (in no case was the time spent worthwhile)"
- "including age in the formulae for the various scalars"
