EC_expectedDomains:
- "Pain in first stage of labour
◦ causes, characteristics, anatomy of primary afferent nerves, spinal segments"
- "Pain in second stage of labour
◦ causes, characteristics, anatomy of primary afferent nerves, spinal segments"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail (especially regarding nerve anatomy, nerve fibre types, pain referral patterns)"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The headings to use were clearly stated in the question. Some candidates chose not to follow this structure, and lost marks because they invariably left out whole sections of the answer."
- "Complex descriptions of central pain pathways including second and third order neurons, spinal tracts, descending inhibitory pathways, and neurotransmitters (despite the question specifying only primary afferents). This information scored no marks."
- "Focusing on neuraxial analgesia, without answering the question asked."
- "Insufficient knowledge of the anatomy."
