title: "Compare and contrast the pharmacology of vecuronium and cisatracurium."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2023
sitting: A
question: 6
passRate: 38
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question was best answered in a table format, allowing for a systematic analysis of the similarities and differences between the two drugs in terms of pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and pharmaceutics. Detail was expected in the answer as these drugs are core in anaesthetic practise."
EC_extraCredit:
- "More detail (e.g. onset time related to molar potency, onset and duration with multiples of ED95, effects of metabolites, other factors which can influence duration)"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Omitting dose, onset time, and duration of action."
- "Listing pharmacokinetic data with no explanation of relevance."
- "Many candidates stated that cisatracurium metabolism occurs by ester hydrolysis."
- "The clinical relevance of laudanosine was often overstated."
- "A surprising number of candidates were not familiar with the use of neostigmine for reversal, and some stated that reversal is not possible or required for cisatracurium."
- "Incorrectly attributing significant haemodynamic effects to these two cardiac stable drugs (histamine release, vagolytic and/or vagotonic effects)"
- "Vague statements such as “low risk of anaphylaxis” without explanation."
