title: "Describe the properties of surfactant and relate these to its role in influencing respiratory mechanics."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2023
sitting: A
question: 11
passRate: 48
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Properties of surfactant
◦ detail about the molecular structure was not needed to pass – but an understanding that the molecule is amphipathic, was required"
- "Role of surfactant in respiratory mechanics
◦ this domain required an understanding of surface tension, how it is reduced by surfactant, and why this is important for respiratory mechanics"
EC_extraCredit:
- "More detail about surfactant structure and synthesis."
- "More detail about surface tension, and the Law of Laplace."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Poor understanding of surface tension."
- "Some candidates focused heavily on clinical aspects of surfactant deficiency and its treatment, without addressing the underlying physiology."
