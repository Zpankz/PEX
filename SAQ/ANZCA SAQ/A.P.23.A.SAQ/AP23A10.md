title: "Describe how oxygen and carbon dioxide are carried by haemoglobin."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2023
sitting: A
question: 10
passRate: 69
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Structure of haemoglobin, relevant to carrying O2 and CO2. This could have been a separate domain, or included under the headings below."
- "O2 transport by Hb"
- "CO2 transport by Hb"
- "Interdependence of O2 and CO2 carriage (i.e. basic mention of Bohr and Haldane effects)"
EC_extraCredit:
- "More detail (e.g. O2 and CO2 Hb dissociation curves, positive cooperativity, detail of Bohr and Haldane effects, Hb structure)"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Not addressing both O2 and CO2 transport (both were needed to pass)."
- "Extensive discussions of O2 and CO2 transport other than by Hb."
- "Confusion about how carbamino compounds are formed and how H+ is buffered by Hb."
- "Not quantifying the amounts of O2 and CO2 carried by Hb."
- "The structure of Hb was often poorly covered."
- "Confusion about the units for gas content."
