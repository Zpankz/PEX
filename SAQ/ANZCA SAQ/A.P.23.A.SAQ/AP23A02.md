EC_expectedDomains:
- "Advantages and disadvantages of N2O when used as part of a general anaesthetic."
- "Good answers were in table form, and tended to take one of two approaches:
◦ Dividing the answer into pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and pharmaceutical factors – this usually led to a reduction in omissions and avoided repetition.
◦ Listing facts about N2O and then expanding as to how each one would be an advantage or a disadvantage."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Breadth of answer."
- "Nuanced discussions, with clinical context."
- "Reference to clinical trials, when correct and discussed in context, was awarded marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Discussing the role of N2O other than during general anaesthesia (e.g. labour ward or ED). This issue was also commented on in the 2021.1 and 2017.1 exam reports. No marks were awarded for this."
- "Listing properties or effects of N2O without discussing these as an advantage or disadvantage."
- "Stating that N2O had MAC-sparing properties, but not elaborating as to why this may be advantageous, or what side effects of other agents were being reduced."
- "Writing long introductory paragraphs defining N2O."
- "Erroneous or contradictory statements regarding the effect of N2O on the cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous systems."
- "Confusion about the difference between N2O supporting combustion and being directly flammable/explosive."
- "Confusing NO and N2O."
