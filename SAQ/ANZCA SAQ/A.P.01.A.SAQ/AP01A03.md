title: "Briefly describe the measurement of pH in a blood sample using a pH electrode"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2001
sitting: A
question: 3
passRate: 52
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected for a pass included:-• the definition of pH• use of an ion-specific electrode, based upon the use of H+-ion sensitive glass• the presence of a buffer solution to maintain a gradient for H+ -ion• the generation of a potential difference, in proportion to H+-ion concentration• the presence of a reference electrode, completing an electrical circuit through a salt bridge, allowing measurement of this potential with a voltmeter or galvanometer• the requirement for regular calibration"
EC_extraCredit:
- "The use of a clearly labelled diagram was beneficial in answering this question, but not essential for a pass. A number of candidates described the electrode based upon \"half-cells\", c.f. the classical description of ion-specific and reference electrodes. On average, candidates using this approach scored well as they appeared to have a clearer understanding of the underlying principles involved. Additional marks were awarded for including further details. Examples of additional information presented by candidates are listed below. It was not expected that candidates would include more than a few of these examples in the time available.• the dependence of H+-ion concentration on temperature and the requirement for temperature control• common sources of error.• the measurement of thermodynamic activity, c.f. concentration• the physical structure pH sensitive glass and the basis of the potential difference generated• the magnitude of voltage produced and calibration to H+-ion concentration• the variation of pH with temperature and Rosenthal's correction factor• the principles of \"pH-stat\" and \"alpha-stat\" measurement• the composition and concentrations of buffer and salt solutions used• the standard calibration solutions used• the use of a thermistor to compensate for temperature changes• the use of either a differential voltage amplifier or \"null deflection circuit\" to measure the small voltages produced"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates confused measurement of H+-ion concentration with arterial PCO2, or the Clark PO2 electrode. Many candidates went into lengthy discussions of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which was not required. A large number expressed that \"the pH electrode produced a current flow which was then measured as pH\"."
