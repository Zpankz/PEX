title: "Give examples of drugs that enhance the action of the non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking agents at the neuromuscular junction. Briefly describe the mechanism of these interactions."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2001
sitting: A
question: 14
passRate: 36
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Inhalational agents such as isoflurane produce CNS depression and reduction in muscle tone, and decrease the sensitivity of the post-junctional membrane to depolarisation. Local anaesthetics such as lignocaine interfere with acetylcholine release, reduce Na+ conductance, reduce the action potential in neighbouring areas to the motor end plate (producing stabilisation of the post-junctional membrane) and cause direct muscle depression. Antibiotics such as the aminoglycosides decrease the release of ACh and decrease the sensitivity of post-synaptic membrane to ACh."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A comparison of the effects of different agents attracted more marks. Drugs that could have been included were diuretics, magnesium, quinidine, trimetaphan, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocking agents and others."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates incorrectly mentioned physiological effects (like temperature and acidosis) and pathological effects like renal and liver impairment. Although an understanding of neuromuscular physiology was essential to answer the question, there was no need for a detailed account of the physiology of the neuromuscular junction with diagrams"
