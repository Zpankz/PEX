title: "Briefly describe the effect of resting muscle length and load conditions on the tension generated by a skeletal muscle. How do these factors affect the velocity of shortening?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2001
sitting: A
question: 2
passRate: 19
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected for a pass were the relationship of resting muscle length to tension development, and the components of active and passive tension which contribute to total tension as length is increased. The inverse relationship of load to velocity of shortening was also expected."
EC_extraCredit:
- "High scoring candidates made effective use of correctly labelled graphs to illustrate points, and explained that developed tension was maximal at resting length. Most candidates were able to illustrate the role of actin/myosin cross-bridge formation in the development of tension."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "There was often confusion with cardiac muscle, and a Frank-Starling mechanism was often invoked for skeletal muscle. Diagrams frequently referred to left ventricular haemodynamics rather than skeletal muscle. Muscle spindle control and Golgi tendon organ involvement were not required in the answer and did not attract marks."
