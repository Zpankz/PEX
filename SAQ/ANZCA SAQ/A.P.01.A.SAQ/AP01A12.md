title: "Briefly describe the respiratory effects of the volatile agents."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2001
sitting: A
question: 12
passRate: 58
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Three key points were required to pass this question.1) control of ventilation and the altered response to hypercarbia and hypoxia.2) change in respiratory pattern, with tachypnoea initially.3) reduction in airway reflexes and upper airway tone."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The use of graphs was a quick and effective way of presenting this information. Differences among the volatile agents should be mentioned. Other useful points included reduced hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, reversal of bronchospasm, airway irritation, increased secretions, reduced ciliary activity, and reduced gas exchange efficiency."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "However an inaccurately drawn graph indicated a lack of understanding in some cases. A common error was to state there was a global reduction in respiratory rate in spite of the daily observation of the reverse even in the presence of opioids."
