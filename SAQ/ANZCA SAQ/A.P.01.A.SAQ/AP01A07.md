title: "Describe how the body detects and responds to water deficit."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2001
sitting: A
question: 7
passRate: 50
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Main points expected were the implications of a water deficit, how this is sensed (emphasising hypothalamic osmoreceptors), and the central role of ADH including its structure, synthesis, transport, release and actions."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Other points that attracted additional marks included the distribution of body water (including normal values), the sensitivity of osmoreceptors vs. volume sensors, and the effects of severe water deficit sufficient to cause intravascular depletion. There was little appreciation that in pure water deficit, a 10% reduction in intravascular volume would be associated with a water deficit of over 4 litres."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A common mistake was to concentrate solely on hyperosmolarity and contraction of the ECF or hyperosmolarity and hypotension. Many candidates failed to indicate that a water deficit involves contraction of both intracellular and extracellular compartments. Pure water deficit does not include Na+ loss, nor does pure water deficit occur in haemorrhage. Thirst is not a \"backup system\" in water deprivation. High pressure baroreceptors do not respond to hypovolaemia."
