entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2001
sitting: A
question: 13
passRate: 55
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Good answers included discussion of:1. Pharmaceutics; complex formulation, possible bacterial growth, incompatibilities and difficulty of detection, glass packaging, expense2. Pharmacokinetics; hepatic (mostly) organ dependent clearance, offset of effect mostly dependent on redistribution, high lipid solubility with consequent easy transfer across placenta3. Pharmacodynamics; a) Central nervous system; decreased cerebral perfusion pressure, excitatory phenomenon, controversial association with epilepsy, not analgesic, mechanism of action not fully understood, no antidote. b) Cardiovascular system; vasodilation, negative inotrope with higher levels, hypotension, depression of baroreceptor response, bradycardia. c) Respiratory system; decreased CO2 and hypoxic response, depressed minute ventilation with possible apnea, depressed airway reflexes/tone with possible aspiration and/or obstruction. d) other; pain on injection with occasional thrombophlebitis, very rarely anaphylaxis."

EC_errorsCommon:
