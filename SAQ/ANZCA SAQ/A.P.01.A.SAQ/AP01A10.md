EC_expectedDomains:
- "The major points expected in the answer were mention of:• the distribution and function of GABA as a major inhibitory neurotransmitter• the distribution and function of GABAA, GABAB (and GABA non A, non B) receptors• GABAA is predominantly a postsynaptic ligand gated chloride ion channel. Binding of the GABAA receptor increases chloride flux and hyperpolarises the cell. Drugs that influence GABAA receptor function include the benzodiazepines, barbiturates, propofol, etomidate, steroidal anaesthetics, ethanol, and possibly volatile anaesthetic agents.• GABAB is a G-protein coupled receptor influencing calcium ion and potassium ion fluxes Baclofen is the best known agonist at GABAB"
