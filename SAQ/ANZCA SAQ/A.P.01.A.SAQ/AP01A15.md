EC_expectedDomains:
- "Those candidates who took a systematic approach to the answer scored better marks and missed fewer important points. It was not adequate to state that a drug was a β1 selective, or a non-selective β-blocker, without describing what this meant in terms of effects on vital organs. Many candidates scored well in describing the contrasting pharmacokinetics of the two agents, but then gave little or no detail on the pharmacodynamic effects of the drugs, particularly their cardiovascular effects that are the main therapeutic target."
EC_extraCredit:
- ""
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Important side effects and contraindications to their use were also frequently omitted. A number of candidates stated that esmolol causes no bronchoconstriction in asthmatics because of its selectivity for β1 receptors. The drug is only selective for β1 receptors at low doses. Few candidates mentioned the exaggerated responses that may occur when sympathetic tone is high."
