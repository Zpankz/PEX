title: "Briefly describe the structure of a mammalian skeletal muscle fibre and explain how its structure is related to its contractile function. DO NOT describe excitation-contraction coupling."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2006
sitting: B
question: 13
passRate: 35
EC_expectedDomains:
- "In order to pass this question, a simple outline of the structural components of the skeletal muscle fibre and their related functions as related to contraction would suffice."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were obtained for a more detailed description of the components of the muscle fibre and for disorders of the fibre structures."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "There were few high scoring answers."
- "Many candidates confused the muscle fibre with myofibril or myofilaments, and as such were not able to obtain sufficient marks to pass."
- "Many candidates failed to appreciate that the skeletal muscle fibre was a cell, and therefore did not mention basic cellular components, especially those modified to have a specific function in skeletal muscle fibres."
