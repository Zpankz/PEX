title: "Compare and contrast the physiological effects of a six hour fast of fluids and food with a twenty four hour fast in a healthy adult."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2006
sitting: B
question: 14
passRate: 33
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To pass this question, candidates were expected to appreciate that a six hour fast occurs daily and is thus well tolerated whilst a twenty four hour fast involves a significant mobilisation of reserves."
- "In doing this, a comparison of the likely water and caloric requirements for each period, with some mention as to the origin of these calories, was required."
- "An appreciation of the total fuel reserves available in a healthy adult, along with recognition of the thirst, hunger, lethargy and other physiological consequences of a twenty four hour fast would round out an acceptable answer."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded to those candidates who were able to more fully quantify the use of reserves during a short and a longer fast and were able to briefly indicate the pathways the body utilises for glucose and ketone production."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Few candidates appreciated that the liver is central in the adaptive process whereby the blood sugar level is maintained by the conversion of fat and amino acids to glucose."
- "The most frequent reasons for not obtaining a pass mark were; the absence of enough information to indicate that the key principals were understood, and failing to mention the actual reserves of energy in the body."
- "Very few candidates mentioned that a twenty four hour fast would render the patient hungry, thirsty and lethargic."
- "Many candidates incorrectly used the words glucagon and glycogen interchangeably."
