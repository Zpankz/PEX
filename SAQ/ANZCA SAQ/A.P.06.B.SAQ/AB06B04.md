title: "Describe the advantages and disadvantages of rocuronium for rapid sequence induction."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2006
sitting: B
question: 04
passRate: 28
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Answers should have indicated the likely doses required for rapid sequence induction because this would determine the onset and offset of neuromuscular block."
EC_extraCredit:
- "It was noted that the better answers were more focused and usually started by stating that rapid sequence induction was a technique designed to secure the airway quickly in patients at risk of aspiration, classically using suxamethonium to cause rapid paralysis."
- "Candidates should also have noted why rocuronium is currently preferred to alternative drugs when suxamethonium is absolutely contraindicated."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates failed because they wrote about the pharmacology of rocuronium without addressing the advantages and disadvantages with regard to rapid sequence induction."
- "Some candidates wasted pages describing all the side effects of suxamethonium that could be avoided with rocuronium."
- "There was large variation in the times given for onset and offset of block for both suxamethonium and rocuronium."
- "Some answers did not explain why the long duration of action with rocuronium could be a disadvantage."
