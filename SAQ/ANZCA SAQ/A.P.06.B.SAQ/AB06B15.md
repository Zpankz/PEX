title: "Explain how a metabolic acidosis develops in hypovolaemic shock. Describe the consequences of this metabolic acidosis for the body."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2006
sitting: B
question: 15
passRate: 53
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Although an understanding of how metabolic acidosis develops in hypovolaemic shock was essential, extra credit was earned for understanding the factors that exacerbate the metabolic acidosis in this situation and for demonstrated knowledge of the metabolic pathways involved."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates who scored well answered the question in a structured fashion, with definitions of the issues at hand and answered both sections."
- "Some candidates demonstrated an excellent understanding of these and how they relate to one another."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A common error among candidates was to detail physiological consequences of hypovolaemic shock at the expense of addressing the physiological consequences of metabolic acidosis."
- "There was limited information on the cardiovascular effects of a metabolic acidosis."
- "Many candidates were able to state that a metabolic acidosis results in myocardial depression."
- "Few were able to outline how a metabolic acidosis effects the response of the cardiovascular system to sympathetic outflow, or at what pH these effects may occur."
- "Respiratory and renal compensatory mechanisms, when addressed, were generally well described."
