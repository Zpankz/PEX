title: "A new clinical test called the “intubation score” has a reported 90% sensitivity and 70% specificity when used to predict difficult intubation. Describe how the accuracy, predictive value and clinical utility of this test can be evaluated. How will the incidence of difficult intubation affect the performance of this test?"

EC_expectedDomains:
- "candidates are expected to: 'Describe the features of a diagnostic test, including the concepts of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and how these are affected by the prevalence of the disease in question.'"
- "Drawing a 2 x 2 table and defining the terms mentioned in the question obtained a pass mark."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The question as to the effect of the incidence of disease on the positive predictive value of a test is of critical importance."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some candidates invoked p values, alpha and beta errors, power and even 't-tests' in their answers, which failed to address the question asked."
- "Changing the incidence of a disease does not alter sensitivity or specificity, as many stated, but as the incidence falls so does the PPV - a restatement of Bayes' Theorem."
- "This is one of the reasons why all of the predictive tests for failed intubation, a relatively uncommon event, have such a low PPV."
- "Unfortunately less than half the candidates accomplished this."
- "There were many blank answers."
