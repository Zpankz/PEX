question: 01
passRate: 73
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Answers should have included discussion of ephedrine and adrenaline (epinephrine)."
- "Credit was also given for discussion of metaraminol, phenylephrine, methoxamine, noradrenaline, dopamine, dobutamine and vasopressin, even if disadvantages outweighed the advantages of the drug."
- "No marks were given for naming a drug without other information."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers included a list of relevant patient problems that contribute to the advantages/disadvantages of the drugs including: Age/intercurrent illness, particularly cardiovascular disease and antihypertensive medications; Pregnancy and childbirth (allowance was made for the differences in prescribed texts regarding ephedrine and phenylephrine); Drug interactions - monoamine oxidase inhibitors."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Given the clinical scenario, a brief summary of pertinent issues resulted in less subsequent repetition."
- "The hypotension results from a change in tone of resistance vessels (reduced systemic vascular resistance). This is accompanied by a decrease in venous return to the heart and a lowering of cardiac output. There may be a lowering of direct sympathetic tone to the heart, leading to a reduction in heart rate and possibly force of contraction."
- "Common features of these agents include: Pharmaceutical presentation - all require dilution before use; Agents with strong vasoconstricting effects have a risk of tissue necrosis if extravasation occurs (including metaraminol); All the drugs have a risk of causing hypertension; Many drugs can cause tachycardia via direct effects or reflex bradycardia."
