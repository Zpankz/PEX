EC_expectedDomains:
- "The physiological response has two broad components. The first is neurologic because of the brains’ reliance on glucose. These symptoms become increasingly serious as the hypoglycaemia worsens and range from confusion to coma, fitting and death. An early component is significant hunger. Associated with the neurologic response is the sympathetic response that is responsible for several of the signs of a “hypo”. This includes agitation, sweating and pallor. The other component is the endocrine response. The “aim” of this is to increase the blood sugar. This response includes decreased insulin production (if any is usually produced), and increased glucagon, cortisol, and growth hormone."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Two errors were to include details of diabetic ketoacidosis and focussing on changes in plasma osmolality based on the equation that includes glucose."
- "A minor point is that the Australian and New Zealand unit for glucose is mmol/l not mg/dl."
