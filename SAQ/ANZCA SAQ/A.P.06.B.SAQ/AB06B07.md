entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2006
sitting: B
question: 07
passRate: 44
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to describe the current management of ventricular fibrillation with particular reference to defibrillation, epinephrine and antiarrhythmic therapy."
- "The important areas to be addressed were: Defibrillation, early intervention, effective therapy, biphasic vs. monophasic, energy settings and mechanism of action; Epinephrine, dose, emphasis on activation of alpha 1 receptors resulting in vasoconstriction and improved coronary and cerebral blood flow; Antiarrhythmic therapy, amiodarone and/or lignocaine with description of dose and mechanism of action; Prioritisation, a description of the sequence of these therapies and how they fit into a cohesive management plan or protocol."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Allowance was made for both old and new guidelines given their recent introduction."
- "Extra marks were gained for a description of the possible role of vasopressin, magnesium, sodium bicarbonate and potassium."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common problems included; no clear sequence of therapies, the importance of defibrillation and energy settings omitted, epinephrine not mentioned or dosage and mechanisms incorrect."
