title: "Describe the determinants of work of breathing in an adult human at rest."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2006
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 62
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected were: Work is the product of pressure x volume and the SI unit is the Joule; Inspiratory work has to overcome elastic and resistance forces; Elastic work consists of deforming elastic tissues and overcoming surface tension; Resistance work must overcome airway resistance and viscous forces; Potential energy is acquired during inspiration and stored elastically to provide energy for passive expiration; The components of work of breathing are best illustrated on a pressure-volume diagram."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional points: The percentage contributions of the components to work of breathing; The oxygen cost and efficiency of work of breathing."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common errors included mislabelling axes and writing detailed descriptions of compliance, airway resistance and patho-physiological conditions."
