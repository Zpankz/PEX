title: "Describe the factors that oppose left ventricular ejection."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2006
sitting: B
question: 09
passRate: 14
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Important points looked for were: Recognition that the sum of factors which oppose LV ejection is afterload; Afterload can also be described as ventricular wall tension."
- "Factors that determine afterload: Systemic Vascular Resistance. Recognition that this is a major contributor to afterload; Left ventricular outflow tract resistance and examples of conditions that change this e.g. aortic stenosis; Effect of aortic compliance on afterload; Ventricular wall factors such as radius and thickness. The relevance of Laplaceâ€™s law in relating ventricular wall radius and thickness to wall tension; Effect of blood viscosity; Effect of arterial impedance; Effect of changes in intrathoracic pressure as a result of IPPV or other states."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Definition, role of SVR in determining afterload and factors which alter SVR attracted extra marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A large proportion of candidates misinterpreted this question to be about determinants of left ventricular ejection fraction and wasted a lot of time on describing pre-load, contractility and heart rate for which no marks were awarded."
- "The fact that IPPV actually reduces afterload by reducing transmural pressure was rarely stated."
