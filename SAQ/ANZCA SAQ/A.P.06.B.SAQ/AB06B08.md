entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2006
sitting: B
question: 08
passRate: 86
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Marks were given for the following points: Toxic dose, expressed ideally in mg/kg or a single toxic dose for adults; Differentiation between a toxic dose and a fatal dose; Normal metabolic pathway of paracetamol; Overdose and relationship of minor metabolic pathway with production of toxic metabolite; Conditions which may exacerbate toxicity; Cellular mechanism of hepatic toxicity; Other features of toxicity e.g. contribution of paracetamol to chronic renal failure; General management issues of drug overdose; Role of N-acetyl cysteine and use of normogram; Monitoring and tests e.g. risk of hypoglycaemia."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most candidates exhibited a sound knowledge of the pathogenesis and toxicity of paracetamol."
- "It was hard to score very highly without mentioning a toxic dose."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates wrote at length about the general pharmacokinetics of paracetamol. This did not attract marks."
- "When fatal doses were mentioned, the range given was from 7 to 30g for an adult."
- "No candidate mentioned the importance of dose/kg reflecting ideal body weight, and precautions in obese patients or children on long-term paracetamol use."
- "Very few candidates mentioned renal toxicity."
- "Common errors referred to the metabolism of paracetamol to phenacetin, usefulness of dialysis and urine pH manipulation in overdose."
