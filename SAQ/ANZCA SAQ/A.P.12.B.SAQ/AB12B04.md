title: "Outline the acute adverse effects of opioid receptor agonists. Describe the mechanisms of the acute adverse effects of opioid receptor agonists."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2012
sitting: B
question: 4
passRate: 55
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Points required: Concise description of side effects, in a systematic manner, with mechanisms, more detail required for important side effects e.g. cardiovascular, respiratory systems."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Bonus marks were given for cough reflex suppression, miosis, and the fact that adverse effects were more likely at the extremes of age and with increasing dose."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common errors included omitting common side effects such as nausea and vomiting."
- "Some gave incorrect statements e.g. nausea is caused by direct action on the vomiting centre."
- "More detail than just the statement “opioids cause respiratory depression” was required. i.e. that they act to depress the central medulla respiratory centre, they shift the PaCO2 / ventilation curve to the right, they reduce respiratory rate more than tidal volume."
- "Some candidates interpreted the question to mean which opioid receptor were responsible for which actions; more general mechanisms were required."
- "Chronic effects e.g. tolerance, dependence, constipation, addiction, hyperalgesia did not garner marks."
- "Meiosis was often mentioned without explanantion. Miosis is the pupillary constriction caused by opioids acting on the oculomotor nucleus."
