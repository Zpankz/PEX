title: "Define the terms “tolerance” and “tachyphylaxis”. Discuss the different mechanisms by which tolerance can develop, giving examples where appropriate."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2012
sitting: B
question: 3
passRate: 45
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected for a pass included definitions for the terms tolerance and tachyphylaxis, as well as a discussion of potential mechanisms by which tolerance could develop."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most answers included good definitions for tolerance and tachyphylaxis and were rewarded for these."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "These mechanisms could be both pharmacokinetic: whereby a drug’s effect lessens due to a lower plasma concentration, and pharmacodynamic: whereby a drug’s effect lessens despite no decrease in plasma concentration."
- "However, pharmacokinetic mechanisms responsible for tolerance were mostly omitted and rarely “discussed” as the question required."
- "Pharmacodynamic mechanisms potentially responsible for tolerance were included in most answers, but were often lacking detail, imprecise or incorrect, and could not be described as a “discussion”."
- "The primary exam is a basic sciences exam and not a clinical exam. Hence, it is expected that answers to the questions address the basic sciences."
