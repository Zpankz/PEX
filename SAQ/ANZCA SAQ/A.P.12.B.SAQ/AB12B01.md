EC_expectedDomains:
- "Management of warfarin reversal lends itself to a discussion of time course and urgency"
EC_extraCredit:
- "There were a few excellent answers with a complete listing of constituents and doses of the latter two agents."
- "Most appreciated the fact that warfarin blocked the conversion of vitamin K from its oxidised state to its reduced form therefore being unable to gamma-carboxylate glutamate residues of factors 2, 7, 9 and 10 as well as the anti-coagulant proteins C and S."
- "The majority of candidates appreciated the significance of the half lives of each and the subsequent propensity of a hypercoagulable state early in warfarin treatment."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "However discussion focused mainly on vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma administration, albeit generally of a high quality."
- "Not all appreciated that stopping the drug prior to elective surgery was an appropriate course of action."
- "Only half mentioned prothrombin complex concentrates ('Prothrombinex') and a handful of answers mentioned activated factor 7 in the 'excessively' warfarinised bleeding patient."
