title: "Discuss the physiological causes of early post-operative hypoxaemia."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2012
sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 28
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question required candidates to address the physiological causes of hypoxaemia."
- "Relevant issues were factors affecting: (i) inspired oxygen tension and increased requirements postoperatively, (ii) alveolar oxygen tension (including minute volume and alveolar ventilation), (iii) alveolar-arterial Hb oxygen transfer (including factors affecting V/Q ratios, shunt and diffusion) and (iv) oxygen demands."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates that included relevant formulae or diagrams to illustrate the physiology (e.g. alveolar gas equation, shunt equation, effects of different V/Q ratios) often successfully and succinctly displayed a great deal of information."
- "Some specific issues, such as diffusion hypoxia , and the shape and position of the Hb dissociation curve, attracted additional marks."
- "The approach of addressing the factors in the chain of oxygen delivery (‘oxygen cascade’), and using examples of failures/changes postoperatively at each step (especially the impact of anaesthesia), was often a successful one."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Using a detailed clinical approach and description (eg patient, surgical and anaesthetic factors; or using clinical signs or symptoms such as airway obstruction, atelectasis, and impaired “respiration”) was common. However, this very frequently failed to allow time to addresses the relevant physiological causes.":
- "The terms “amount” or “levels” were a not infrequent, and poor, descriptor of the term."
