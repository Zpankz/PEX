EC_extraCredit:
- "Using multiple examples helped candidates score well."
- "Candidates that could directly discuss mechanisms of toxicity on different organ systems scored well."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A classification of local, systemic and other was often used."
- "Using an ester/amide classification was acceptable, but candidates then often struggled to give good examples when this template was used."
- "The potential for toxicity portion of the question was often poorly done."
- "While methaemoglobinaemia was often described well, simple discussion regarding dose, concentration, site of administration, use of additives and the effect of physiological and pathological states was often neglected."
- "Discussions of CC/CVS ratio seemed to sidetrack candidates from answering the individual components of the question."
- "Presenting pharmacokinetic data without outlining how this was related to toxicity was not required."
