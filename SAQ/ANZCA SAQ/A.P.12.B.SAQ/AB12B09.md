title: "Describe the waveforms and pressures that are seen in each anatomical location during insertion of a pulmonary arterial catheter. What factors may increase these pressures?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2012
sitting: B
question: 9
passRate: 68
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better candidates provided an organised list of the factors that increase pressures at each of the above anatomical locations."
- "Extra marks were awarded for detailed descriptions of the components of each waveform."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates could provide a reasonable account of the waveforms and pressures in the superior vena cava, right atrium, right ventricle and pulmonary artery."
- "Common omissions were a description of the pulmonary capillary wedge trace."
- "Many candidates did not answer the second part of this question at all, or did not allow themselves sufficient time to answer it adequately."
- "There was considerable confusion regarding the factors that increase pulmonary arterial pressure."
- "Pulmonary hypertension was frequently listed as a cause of (rather than another term for) increased pulmonary arterial pressure."
- "Few candidates noted that increased pulmonary venous pressure (from any cause) increases pulmonary arterial pressure."
- "No marks were awarded for describing how pulmonary arterial catheters are inserted or how they are used for cardiac output measurement."
