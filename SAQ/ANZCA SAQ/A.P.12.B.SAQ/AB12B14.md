EC_errorsCommon:
- "Much candidate effort was wasted with the following content: rewriting the question; description of the size, anatomy and blood flow of the liver; details of drug metabolism; extensive description of metabolic functions; listing functions of the liver without reference to the specific question that was asked."
- "It was frequently but unimpressively stated that you would die without your liver."
