title: "Compare and contrast propofol and sevoflurane for maintenance of anaesthesia with respect to kinetics, cardiovascular and central nervous system effects."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2012
sitting: B
question: 2
passRate: 22
EC_expectedDomains:
- "There are three parts to the question."
- "Note that the question specifically refers to maintenance rather than onset on anaesthesia."
- "A comparison of the drugs was required"
EC_extraCredit:
- "It is important to show understanding of what figures mean, rather than just quoting lists of numbers."
- "Both drugs can be described using a three compartment model."
- "When calculating offset of effect, redistribution of propofol is less important in an infusion than with a bolus dose."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates who did not address all areas rarely passed."
- "Separate essays lost marks."
- "Vague statements such as, “Propofol is metabolised in the liver”, did not attract marks."
- "Many candidates believed that there is a negative feedback loop between end tidal concentration and minute volume in a spontaneously breathing patient. This is only true when using an in-circuit vaporiser."
- "To compare sevoflurane with desflurane rather than propofol"
- "To assume the blood gas coefficient equates to lipid solubility."
- "To mis-state the metabolites of sevoflurane, or to assume that Compound A is produced in the body."
- "To oversimplify the effect of sevoflurane on cerebral blood flow and ICP."
- "When attempting to turn over cases in the operating theatre, a half life of 40 minutes is not considered short."
- "Non standard ones such as DD do."
