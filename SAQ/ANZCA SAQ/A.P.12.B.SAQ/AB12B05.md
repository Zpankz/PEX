title: "Discuss the pharmacology of drugs that inhibit the activity of the renin-angiotensin system. What particular problems can occur in the anaesthetised patient taking these drugs?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2012
sitting: B
question: 5
passRate: 35
EC_expectedDomains:
- "As indicated in the question it was specifically expected candidates would comment on problems that may arise with anaesthesia and in particular some comment regarding potential hypotension was expected."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good answers often gave a brief outline of the physiology and related this to the mechanism of action of the various agents."
- "Additional marks were awarded for comments indicating some agents were administered as pro-drugs, the main side effect profile (cough, angioedema, renal impairment and hypotension to name a few) and the mechanism behind these."
- "A traditional structured pharmacology approach readily allowed the candidate to mention examples of each group, the specific mechanisms of action, possible uses, route of administration and some comment about general pharmacokinetics, in particular any differences of note."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A common omission was that answers only included a discussion about the physiology of the RAS with no comment on pharmacology of the relevant agents."
- "An in depth of knowledge of their pharmacology was not required with “high light” comments of the main pharmacology scoring well."
