question: 11
passRate: 10
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were available to candidates who included some of the less obvious but important functions of the lymphatic system such as the return of protein to the circulation, the presentation of antigen presenting cells to the lymph nodes and the role in the formation of a concentrated urine by removing the protein rich ISF in the medulla allowing water to enter the vasa recta thus allowing maintenance of the osmotic gradient."
- "The better answers demonstrated a sound underlying structure (such as above) and this resulted in those candidates able to include many of the points required for a good answer."
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A useful strategy for answering this question could have seen a two sentence introduction overviewing the role of the lymphatics in the body followed by paragraphs on the structure/anatomy, composition, principal functions of the lymphatics and a brief overview of factors that would see an increase in lymph formation."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The most common reason for not passing this question was simply not including enough material in the answer."
- "Many candidatesâ€™ answers were far too brief and thus did not cover the topic broadly enough to gain a pass."
- "Repetition of information was present in many answers but this was not rewarded with additional credit."
