title: "Write brief notes on the physiological changes associated with sleep."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2014
sitting: B
question: 15
passRate: 46
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A definition of sleep was expected, as well as an explanation of the stages of sleep: non-REM (stages 1 to 4), and REM."
- "The EEG changes occurring in each stage were required, however EEG changes were often quoted with little or no explanation (e.g. “delta waves” without defining this as high amplitude, low frequency EEG)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Marks were awarded for explaining the relative times spent in each stage, how this changes as sleep progresses, and changes through the lifespan."
- "Other points able to gain marks included the effects of sleep on: cardiovascular, temperature, skeletal muscle, GIT, endocrine/metabolic, and renal systems."
- "Also the reasons for sleep, and effects of sleep deprivation."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates were frequently confused about these points – for example, stating that REM is stage 4, or that stage 1 is awake."
- "Significant marks were available for explaining the respiratory changes in sleep. This was poorly addressed in the majority of answers."
- "Although pharyngeal tone is decreased, with snoring common, it is not normal to develop sleep apnoea, become hypoxic, or have Cheyne-Stokes breathing when asleep."
- "Very few candidates mentioned the CNS circuitry which produces sleep, or the neurotransmitters involved."
