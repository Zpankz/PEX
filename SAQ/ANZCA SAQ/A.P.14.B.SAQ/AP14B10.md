title: "How is renal blood flow regulated? What are the physiological effects of angiotensin II?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2014
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 57
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Better answers were written with a reasonable structure that included: • A definition of renal blood flow, with normal values • Flow = renal perfusion pressure / renal vascular resistance. • The anatomy of renal blood supply (only a brief description was necessary) and recognition that the vascular tone of the afferent and efferent arterioles is the main determinant of renal vascular resistance. • Describing autoregulation between a range of mean arterial pressures (A wide range of values was accepted here). • An explanation of myogenic autoregulation. This was often overlooked or not discussed in much detail. • Notes about tubuloglomerular feedback, including the structure and function of the juxtaglomerular complex, and the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone cascade. • The role of the sympathetic nervous system."
- "A list of these was sufficient for a pass mark – in particular the cardiovascular, CNS, renal and autonomic effects."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional points were awarded for extra detail about release and effects of local and circulating hormones (such as ANP/noradrenaline/adrenaline/adenosine/NO/prostaglandins) on afferent and efferent arteriole tone."
- "Further marks were awarded for an increased level of detail."
- "More marks were awarded if this was followed with a description that angiotensin acted on peripheral arteries and veins, leading to an increase in SVR and MAP."
- "Credit was given if candidates could explain that the net effect of an increased level of angiotensin II is to increase water/salt retention and increase the effective circulating volume."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common errors included: confusing glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow, vague and imprecise statements about effects of different hormones, omitting detail and listing bullet points without explanation."
- "The renal effects were reasonably well described, but few candidates explained that angiotensin II has a greater effect on the efferent arteriole than the afferent arteriole."
