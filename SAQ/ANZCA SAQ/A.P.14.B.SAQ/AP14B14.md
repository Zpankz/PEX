title: "Outline the effects of intravenously administering 500 ml of 20% mannitol. Outline the potential problems associated with its use."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2014
sitting: B
question: 14
passRate: 67
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was difficult to pass this questions without addressing both parts; specifically, effects and potential problems."
- "An outline of its effects was ideally presented under headings that included effects on plasma osmolarity and the renal tubules."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most successful candidates identified 20% mannitol as an osmotic diuretic."
- "Better responses identified the phasic nature of mannitol’s effects."
- "An outline of cardiovascular effects via volume load and subsequent plasma expansion was also rewarded."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "However, lengthy and intricate discussions of Starling’s forces, baroceptor reflexes, and the cellular mechanisms of natriuretic peptides and anti-diuretic hormone were usually at the expense of scoring elsewhere."
- "More detailed physiological discussions often become self-contradictory."
- "Despite identifying mannitol as an osmotic diuretic, some argued that it works at the renal tubule via an osmoreceptor response that upregulates antiduretic hormone sectretion in the pituitary."
