title: "Describe the washout of desflurane from a patient following six hours of general anaesthesia. You may wish to use a graph to illustrate the description."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2014
sitting: B
question: 2
passRate: 52
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected for a pass centred on a detailed description of the clearance of desflurane from the lungs when the inspired fraction is rapidly reduced to zero, and how multiple body compartments empty simultaneously, but at different rates, pertaining to their volume, perfusion and desfluraneâ€™s differential solubility in those compartments."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A graph demonstrating the washout of desflurane, when used to illustrate the pharmacokinetic description above, also attracted marks."
- "There were some excellent answers."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Roughly half of candidates did not achieve a pass principally because they did not specifically address the question asked."
- "Examples included answers comparing and contrasting the different rates of washout between different volatile agents instead."
- "Another common misinterpretation was to discuss the offset of clinical effects of the agent rather than the requested pharmacokinetics."
