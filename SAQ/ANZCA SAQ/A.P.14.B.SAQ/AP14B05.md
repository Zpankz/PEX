title: "Describe the physiology of the pain pathways and how drugs may modulate the perception of pain."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2014
sitting: B
question: 5
passRate: 50
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Better answers were based upon an anatomical approach."
- "More complete answers had a definition of pain, location and stimuli of peripheral receptors, pain fibres (A delta and C fibres), cord pathways (including dorsal horn lamina, neo and paleospinothalamic tracts), central perception, descending pathways, and the modulation by drugs at each of these points."
EC_extraCredit:
- "More detail gained extra marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Diagrams, although useful, often resulted in a lack of detail, for example labelling C and A delta fibres without providing additional information, or repeating what was already written down."
- "When discussing modulation by drugs, a mechanism of action was expected, not just the class or name of the drug."
- "The use of the word ‘etc’ did not attract marks."
