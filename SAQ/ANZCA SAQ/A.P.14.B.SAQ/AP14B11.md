title: "Describe the cardiovascular changes that occur with morbid obesity."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2014
sitting: B
question: 11
passRate: 3
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question required an understanding of the cardiovascular changes in obesity per se as opposed to those associated with the co-morbid conditions of hypertension, diabetes and coronary artery disease."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates who used a systemic approach, such as describing the changes in cardiac output, heart rate, stroke volume, systemic vascular resistance, afterload, preload and contractility, did better."
- "Extra points were awarded to ECG changes, the cardiovascular responses to exercise and to the understanding of the hormonal changes that underpin the majority of cardiovascular changes seen in the obese patient."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "There were many misconceptions about the cardiovascular physiology in the uncomplicated obese patient especially regarding systemic vascular resistance/afterload and heart rate."
- "Adipose tissue does not compress the arteries causing hypertension."
- "Obese patients do not have increased resistance due to longer blood vessels. Otherwise all tall people would be hypertensive as well."
- "Obese patients do not have a resting tachycardia to maintain cardiac output."
- "Many mentioned increased blood volume but failed to equate this to increased preload and stroke volume."
- "The mechanism behind left ventricular hypertrophy in obesity was misunderstood."
