entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2014
sitting: B
question: 4
passRate: 5
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To gain a pass mark candidates needed to describe the components, functions and features of an active scavenging system."
- "This could be done by dividing the scavenging system into components: I. collecting assembly (shroud) – input from APL and ventilator II. transfer system – specific tubing features and occlusive problems III. receiving system or scavenging interface – flow control, reservoir, valve functions, system volume IV. disposal system – conduit material, vacuum source, venting"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for diagrams, stating why scavenging is important, circumstances where scavenging is not effective, and potential problems with the system."
- "Marks were awarded for explaining the difference between an open and closed active system were rewarded."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Marks were not awarded for comments on passive systems, greenhouse gas effects or descriptions of soda lime."
- "Descriptions of an operating theatre air-circulation system was not considered relevant."
- "Several candidates believed that active scavenging recirculated anaesthesia gases back to the patient for re-use, but this is incorrect."
