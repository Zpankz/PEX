title: "Explain the Bohr and Haldane effects in trans-placental gas exchange."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2014
sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 31
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Good answers to this question contained definitions and descriptions of the Bohr and Haldane effects and also a summary of transplacental gas exchange, indicating why these two effects are important in this special organ bed."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A diagram with accurate values for gas tensions and saturations was an effective way of summarizing gas exchange in the placenta."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The double Bohr and double Haldane effects were usually described at length- the same number of marks could be earned with a single well constructed sentence covering the same principles, thus saving time."
- "In any question about physiology it is important to describe the physiological effect but also the mechanisms behind it; the physiology at a molecular level of haemoglobin involved in the Haldane effect was often described in this question but the characteristics of haemoglobin specific to the Bohr effect were not."
