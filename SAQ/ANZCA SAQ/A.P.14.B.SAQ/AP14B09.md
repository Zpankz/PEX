EC_expectedDomains:
- "To construct a good answer, this question required the candidate to integrate a number of syllabus areas."
- "Candidates should begin with defining SpO2, and establishing a normal range."
- "The relationships between SpO2, SaO2, paO2, oxygen content and oxygen delivery should be explained, as well as the factors that affect these relationships."
EC_extraCredit:
- "All proposed lower limits of acceptable SpO2 gained marks, so long as the reasoning was valid."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The SpO2 that correlated with hypoxaemia was often proposed."
- "Assorted definitions of hypoxaemia were offered."
- "The deleterious effects of borderline hypoxaemia were often not mentioned, or overstated."
- "Expected acute compensatory mechanisms were rarely mentioned."
- "Duration of hypoxaemia should be considered when setting a lower acceptable limit."
- "Terms such as “physiologic reserve” and “acute compromise” should not be used without adequate explanation."
