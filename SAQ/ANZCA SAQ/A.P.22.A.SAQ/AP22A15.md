EC_errorsCommon:
- "lack of detail"
- "vitamin D and erythropoietin were the domains most commonly lacking in sufficient detail"
- "many candidates wasted time by discussing substances which acted upon the kidney but were not “produced within, or activated by, the kidney”."

- "very few candidates were able to integrate the many downstream effects of renin into a global mechanism for homeostasis"
- "poor time management appeared to be a problem in a number of answers."
