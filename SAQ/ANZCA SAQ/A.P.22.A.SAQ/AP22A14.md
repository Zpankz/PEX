title: "On the same axes, draw the oxy-haemoglobin dissociation curve for both foetal and adult haemoglobin. Explain why these curves are different, and the physiological advantages of these differences."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2022
sitting: A
question: 14
passRate: 48
EC_expectedDomains:
- "draw the OHDC curves"
- "explain why they are different"
- "discuss the advantages"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates passed the first section if they could correctly draw the curves with labelled axes and correct p50 values for adult and foetal haemoglobin."
- "The second part required an understanding of the different structures of adult and foetal haemoglobin, and their relative affinity for binding 2,3, DPG."
- "The third part required candidates to understand what an increased affinity for oxygen by foetal haemoglobin actually meant â€“ i.e., for any given pO2, foetal haemoglobin has a higher saturation."
- "This increased haemoglobin oxygen content for any given pO2, together with increased haemoglobin concentration, results in adequate oxygen delivery to foetal tissues, despite a low pO2 environment."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Given the OHDC is considered fundamental basic knowledge, it was disappointing to see many curves not having an origin of 0, and saturations frequently exceeding 100%."
- "Statements regarding factors shifting the OHDC to the left or right had to be relevant."
- "The importance of the Bohr and Haldane effects was frequently overstated (contributes 2-8%)."
