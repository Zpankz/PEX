EC_errorsCommon:
- "Hartmann’s solution does not cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis."
- "Hartmann’s solution is slightly hypotonic compared with plasma, even before the metabolism of lactate."
- "The lactate load from 2L Hartmann’s is tiny in comparison to daily lactate production."
- "The purpose of the Cori cycle is not to produce HCO3."
- "The significance of venous capacitance as a volume buffer was largely overlooked."
- "The high- and low-pressure baroreceptor systems have different efferent limbs. They were often confused."
