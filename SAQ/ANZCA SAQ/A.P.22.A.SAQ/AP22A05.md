title: "On the same axes, draw wash-in curves for the first 30 minutes administration of: • 70% nitrous oxide • 6% desflurane • 2% sevoflurane. Explain why the curves are different for each agent."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2022
sitting: A
question: 5
passRate: 67
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Wash in curve"
- "Blood Gas Partition Coefficient"
- "Concentration Effect"
- "Integration of concepts"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers included a detailed, well labelled, quantitative and qualitative graph which was followed by a structured analysis, synthesis and integration of the key contributing factors accounting for the differences."
- "An explanation for the bends in the curve or phases was expected."
- "The second part of the question required discussion of relative solubility with reference to blood gas partition coefficients (BGPC); and the concentration effect."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "inaccurate curve relationships with respect to timing (X axis) and FA/FI ratio (Y axis)"
- "failure to define FA and FI"
- "poorly labelled axes including omission of numeric values on each axis"
- "incorrect relative solubility."
- "confusion surrounding the concentration effect and concentrating effect"
- "facts listed but without adequate explanation"
