title: "Draw and label a graph of a normal basic viscoelastic test of clotting function. What information about the physiology of clotting is depicted in this graph? How will the graph be altered by hyperfibrinolysis?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2022
sitting: A
question: 4
passRate: 25
EC_expectedDomains:
- "draw a graph of a viscoelastic test of clotting function"
- "link the graph to the physiology"
- "describe the effect of hyperfibrinolysis"
EC_extraCredit:
- "To pass the first section, it was necessary to reproduce a basic outline of a TEG or ROTEM test, along with some clearly labelled common indices (such as R time/CT, alpha angle, MA/MCF etc)."
- "Credit was awarded for including normal values."
- "The second part of the answer needed to link the various components of the coagulation process with specific phases of the graph (such as the contribution of platelets to MA/MCF etc)."
- "The final part of the question required either a graphical depiction, or a written description, of the characteristic changes seen in hyperfibrinolysis."
- "Credit was given for an explanation of the pathophysiology, and the role of APTEM, but was not required to pass."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "imprecise or incorrect labelling of the graph"
- "lack of x and/or y-axes"
- "incorrect units or numbers"
- "directionless comments (for example: alpha angle is affected by fibrinogen)"
- "confusing hyperfibrinolysis with hypofibrinogenaemia"
- "lack of understanding regarding the contribution of specific components of coagulation to various phases of the graph."
- "not realising that thrombolysis is a normal part of the coagulation process"
