title: "Compare and contrast the effects of the right lateral position (right side down) on lung ventilation and perfusion in a healthy 70 kg patient who is a) Awake, breathing spontaneously b) Anaesthetised, paralysed, with IPPV"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2022
sitting: A
question: 3
passRate: 46
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The effect of the right lateral position on ventilation during spontaneous breathing"
- "perfusion during spontaneous breathing"
- "ventilation during IPPV"
- "perfusion during IPPV"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Credit was given to those answers that went beyond simply stating facts and explaining how the observed changes in either ventilation or perfusion occur."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "not structuring an answer to discuss all aspects of a two-part question - often the effect of right lateral position was discussed in-depth, but the effect of anaesthesia only mentioned in passing."
- "correctly drawing graphs then contradicting the information contained therein during the narrative component of their answer"
- "failing to distinguish between relative or absolute changes."
