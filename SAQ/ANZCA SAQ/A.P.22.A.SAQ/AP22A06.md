title: "Using a labelled diagram, describe how a self-inflating bag-valve-mask resuscitation device works."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2022
sitting: A
question: 6
passRate: 51
EC_expectedDomains:
- "draw a labelled diagram including mask, non- rebreathing expiratory valve, self-inflating bag, reservoir bag and oxygen inlet"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Credit was given for answers which included more details, including but not limited to air entrainment valve, oxygen overflow valve and high-pressure relief valve."
- "As noted in previous examiner reports, an understanding of the non-rebreathing valve in both expiration and inspiration was central to passing this question."
- "The candidates who explained this invariably scored well."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "not drawing or discussing the non-rebreathing valve mechanism"
- "most candidates were aware that the device could be used without an oxygen source and many candidates appreciated that there was an air entrainment valve, but few candidates could describe how the air entrainment valve worked."
- "very few candidates discussed the factors which could lead to an FiO2 < 100%."
- "most candidates mentioned the option of using a PEEP valve. However, there was substantial confusion about where it goes, and it was often confused with a high- pressure relief valve. High-pressure relief valves were included by many candidates but were often misplaced."
- "A small number of candidates confused the bag-valve-mask system with a Mapleson B/C circuit."
