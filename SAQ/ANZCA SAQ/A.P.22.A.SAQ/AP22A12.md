title: "Define cardiac preload, and describe its determinants"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2022
sitting: A
question: 12
passRate: 44
EC_expectedDomains:
- "offer a mainstream definition of cardiac preload, relate it to stroke volume and discuss factors that influence it (determinants)"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Adequate definitions mentioned sarcomere length at the end of diastole or just prior to contraction."
- "The definition should have included reference to end-diastolic volume Likewise, mention of association with stroke volume at some point in the answer was important to demonstrate understanding."
- "More refined answers clearly and accurately identified differences between right and left heart preload. Some went further and acknowledged differences and interaction between atria and ventricles as well."
- "Better answers appreciated the overlap between concepts and used each section to efficiently strengthen other components."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Defining preload as venous return was a common oversimplification."
- "It was difficult to convey understanding of preload and its associated physiological concepts with this restricted focus."
- "Challenges also arose from blurring the concepts of preload, afterload and contractility."
