title: "Explain the physiological processes involved in the development of interstitial oedema."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2004
sitting: B
question: 16
passRate: 76
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points were: the variables contributing to Starling forces, lymphatics, and mechanisms changing these variables. Amongst others, these mechanisms included decreased arteriolar tone, increased venous tone, and increased permeability and surface area."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional points were definitions of oedema and the interstial space, and that as oedema develops changes in the interstitial Starling variables limit the formation of oedema."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This was an applied physiology question; the most common omission was discussion of how Starling forces contribute to oedema rather than the normal balance of the forces and many candidates repeated information or discussed the consequences of oedema rather than the development of oedema."
