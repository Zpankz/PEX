EC_expectedDomains:
- "A complete answer was helped by organising the essay around sub- headings such as pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects and so on."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Some candidates noted other interesting features of the drug such as an improvement in oral bioavailability with multiple dosing; the suggestion that tramadol might increase the risk of awareness under general anaesthesia and that tramadol’s analgesic effect might be antagonised by 5HT3 antagonists."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "While most answers recognised that tramadol is presented as a racemic mixture, only a proportion went on to say that each isomer had specific effects contributing to the analgesic effect of the drug."
- "Likewise, while the majority of answers noted that the drug has actions on opioid and non-opioid sites, nobody mentioned that the drug’s analgesic effect is as a result of this somewhat peculiar synergistic activity."
- "Pharmacokinetic aspects were less well handled with many failing to note that tramadol is highly metabolised and that one metabolite (M1 or O-desmethyl tramadol) has considerable activity at the opioid receptor and may contribute to the drugs activity. As with codeine, a proportion of patients deficient in the P450 cytochrome CYP2D6 enzyme will fail to form this product and may exhibit reduced analgesia."
