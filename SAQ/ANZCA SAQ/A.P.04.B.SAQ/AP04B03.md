title: "List the effects of histamine. Write a brief outline on the pharmacology of the H1 blocking drugs."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2004
sitting: B
question: 03
passRate: 26
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The first part of the question asked for a list of effects."
- "Less than half the candidates produced a minimal list that included bronchoconstriction, vasodilatation, increased vascular permeability, acid secretion and one central nervous system effect."
- "The second part of the question was also handled poorly, with a significant number of candidates leaving it unanswered, discussing H2 blocking drugs, or other drugs that were not antihistamines."
- "it was necessary to include other examples. Specific H1 blockers are relatively new and used mainly for the management of allergic conditions. Older antihistamines are not specific, have more diverse indications, and often have a number of side effects."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers were able to ascribe the correct receptor subtypes to a comprehensive list, and also include the effects of histamine at a cellular level."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "It was not productive to write notes on the chemistry or distribution of histamine, or discuss its role in anaphylaxis."
- "Some candidates wrote about only one antihistamine, but because the H1blockers are a diverse group"
- "Although several uses were often listed for H1 blockers, it was important to match these with an appropriate drug because not every antihistamine is appropriate for every indication."
