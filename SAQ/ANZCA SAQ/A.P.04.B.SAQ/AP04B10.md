title: "List the physiological factors which affect left atrial pressure and explain their effects."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2004
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 19
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were rewarded one mark for each correct factor they listed. The list of factors could be considered in three categories: Venous return: influenced by blood volume, posture, venous tone, intrathoracic pressure and intrapericardial pressure, Left ventricular emptying: influence by contractility and afterload, Left ventricular filling: influenced by the diastolic compliance and mitral valve disease."
- "For the second part of the question, marks were awarded for a statement as to how the left atrial pressure (LAP) would be affected by a change in each of the factors listed by the candidate."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additionally, listing variations in heart rate and obstruction to pulmonary flow were rewarded with additional marks."
- "Whilst a statement of the range of normal LAP gained further credit"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates only listed a few of the factors that affect LAP thus limiting the mark they could expect to achieve."
- "A common misunderstanding was the effect of an increase in intrathoracic pressure on the LAP with many candidates concluding that IPPV will increase the LAP."
- "the range of pressures quoted was often incorrect."
