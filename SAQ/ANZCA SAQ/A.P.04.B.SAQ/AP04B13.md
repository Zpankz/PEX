EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question asked about gastric secretions and their actions."
- "The constituents needed to be identified, namely HCl, pepsinogen, mucus and bicarbonate, intrinsic factor (IF) and gastrin."
- "The breakdown of the action of each of these components was useful in an organised answer to the question."
- "Example: HCI Main points such as activation of pepsinogen to pepsin by HCl, its direct proteolytic action, its bactericidal property and its effect on ‘innate immunity’."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional points were attracted for mention of other constituents e.g. gastric lipase and their functions."
- "Additional points were attracted for discussion of its effect on ferric ion to its more soluble ferrous form, and its stimulant action on biliary and pancreatic secretions."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Lengthy descriptions of the control of gastric secretions did not attract marks and would have consumed a significant component of the time available."
- "Some answers did not go beyond control of gastric secretions and did not answer the question asked."
