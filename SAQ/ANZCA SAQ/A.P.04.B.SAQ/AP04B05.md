entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2004
sitting: B
question: 05
passRate: 49
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Answers needed to include the following points. The RCT is a “gold standard”, level II evidence clinical trial allocating volunteers or subjects to one of two groups i.e. a control and a treatment group."
- "Strengths lie in: Ability to assign and administer treatment or intervention in a precise, controlled way (avoiding differing techniques), Randomisation of subjects or participants aims at decreasing selection bias and minimizing confounders due to unequal distribution in a chosen population, Measurements, especially parametric data can be chosen precisely making it easier to make observations consistently, Blinding is easier in RCT improving credibility plus decreasing patient or observer bias, Controlling of group allocations enhance similarity of baseline features so it is easier to form basis for statistical hypothesis"
- "Weaknesses include: The increased expense and time consumption, difficult to organize/supervise if multiple sites/locations, Realization that results may not always mimic real life treatment situation, Risk of choosing treatments or subjects whose consent is not valid or unethical treatment is involved"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Some other valid points were made: If a small trial can include very stringent parameters which are somewhat of an academic nature but will decrease Type I errors as well as test efficacy. Such RCT may lack applicability and be too specific for a chosen population."
- "RCTs can have subgroup analysis enhancing the usefulness for clinical practice."
- "A successful RCT with conclusive or inconclusive results is eminently publishable."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Can make the trial large good for detecting small but clinically relevant conclusions more expensive yet decreasing Type II errors"
