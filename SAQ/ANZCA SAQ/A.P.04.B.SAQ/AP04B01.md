title: "Briefly describe how drugs produce their pharmacological effects. Illustrate each mechanism with examples."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2004
sitting: B
question: 01
passRate: 67
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Generally discussion of receptor mediated mechanisms was excellent, with ligand gated, G-protein, tyrosine kinase & intracellular DNA receptors being well covered with appropriate examples."
- "For a complete answer non-receptor mechanisms also include carrier molecules, effects on enzymes, direct chemical interaction, colligative properties and structural analogues (counterfeiting)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Finally mechanisms which are unknown or not fully elucidated are relevant and received marks (eg volatile anaesthetic agents, placebo effect)."
- "Good answers divided the answer into receptor and non-receptor mechanisms and didnâ€™t get bogged down in one area."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some candidates confused local anaesthetics as being ligand gated receptor mediated when in fact they have direct action on ion channels."
- "Some candidates gave erudite discussions on pharmacokinetics but this did not answer the question."
- "A common issue was spending too much discussion on G-protein coupled receptors at the expense of other areas."
