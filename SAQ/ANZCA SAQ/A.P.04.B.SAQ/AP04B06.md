EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected in the answer in order to pass were considered under three main headings – (i) pharmacokinetics (ii) mode of action and (iii) pharmacological effects, mainly due to increased acetylcholine."
- "They are both anti-cholinesterases which inhibit both acetylcholinesterase and plasma cholinesterase."
- "There are important differences in polarity and lipid solubility which contribute to contrasting distribution in the body for the two compounds. Neostigmine is not distributed to the central nervous system (CNS) whereas organophosphorus compounds are widely distributed including the CNS. Neostigmine is an ionised water- soluble compound which has hepatic and renal elimination. Organophosphorus compounds depend on synthesis of acetylcholinesterase because of the stability of the enzyme-inhibitor complex and a process called “aging”."
- "Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase not only increases the concentration of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction but at all other synapses that use acetylcholine as a transmitter. These include the muscarinic receptors of the parasympathetic nervous system, the nicotinic receptors of the autonomic ganglia, and the smooth muscles especially of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. Organophosphorus compounds have CNS muscarinic effects that include excitation, confusion and coma."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The mode of action for neostigmine at the target enzyme is similar to the way acetylcholine is handled, except the covalent bond of the carbamoylated enzyme is considerably more resistant to hydration and leads to a prolonged thirty minute duration of effect."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A common mistake was to not discuss the actions of the drugs."
- "Organophosphorus compounds have a half-life of weeks to months because of phosphorylation of the esteratic site covalent bond."
