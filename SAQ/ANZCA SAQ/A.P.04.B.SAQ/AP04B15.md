title: "Describe the mechanism of action of G-proteins in the cell."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2004
sitting: B
question: 15
passRate: 60
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To achieve a pass mark, it was expected that the answer would include: An indication of the general concept of G-proteins acting as a kind of transducer, converting an extra- cellular event (ligand associating with a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)) into a series of intra- cellular events involving 2nd messenger systems, A summary of the sequence of events that occurs in this transduction i.e. ligand binds to receptor, brings about a conformational change such that the α-subunit of the G-protein binds GTP, then dissociates from the βγ subunits. The α-GTP then activates a 2nd messenger system, or directly acts upon an ion channel, in some cases the βγ subunit can also activate ion channels. The intrinsic GTP- ase of the α-subunit acts as a self-limiting step to deactivate and allow recombination of the subunits, Mention of at least a couple of different kinds of G-proteins e.g. Gs, Gi, Gq, Gt, etc and their associated 2nd messenger systems e.g. adenylate cyclase/cAMP, PLC/IP3/DAG, cardiac K-channels, etc, Preferably, examples of receptors associated with each of the mentioned G-protein types."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were obtained for a detailed description of the mechanism described above, including for mentioning and understanding such features of the system as amplification, self-regulation, uni-directionality and sustained duration; for more complete lists of G-protein types and associated 2nd messengers; for accurate description of the structure as currently appreciated; and also for mention of the existence of “small G” proteins and their role in intracellular organelle function and gene expression."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common mistakes, none of which precluded passing the question as a whole, were: describing the G-protein as either a receptor or as a 2nd messenger. Often answers began by saying the G-protein was a receptor then describing the process outlined above where the GPCR is a separate entity. , stating that G-proteins are guanine nucleotides or similar comments, describing the role of ATP rather than GTP in activation, describing the structure of G-proteins as serpentine, 7-trans-membrane-spanning, or similar"
- "Some answers gave great detail on the roles of cAMP, DAG, IP3 etc which while usually correct was not relevant and so did not score marks."
