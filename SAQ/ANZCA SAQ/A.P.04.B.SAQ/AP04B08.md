EC_expectedDomains:
- "A good answer included information on ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics, digoxin and nitrates."
- "Ideally, mechanisms included the cellular or receptor mechanism of drug action and effects of preload, contractility, afterload and alterations in renal function."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Mention could also be made of calcium channel blockers, orally administered phosphodiesterase inhibitors and new drugs, but preferably with comments about why they are not often used in the treatment of chronic failure."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates omitted one or more of the major drug classes."
- "Many candidates spent a lot of time describing drugs used in the management of acute or acute-on-chronic failure, such as adrenaline, dobutamine, oxygen, calcium, glucagon and phosphodiesterase inhibitors."
- "Some discussed drugs used in the treatment of associated conditions such as hypertension or ischaemic heart disease."
- "Some candidates wrote about drugs that are not used currently in chronic heart failure such as hydrallazine and sodium nitroprusside."
