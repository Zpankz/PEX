title: "Outline the factors which influence the elimination half-life of propofol."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2004
sitting: B
question: 07
passRate: 29
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question focused on the application of pharmacokinetics principles to the systemic elimination of propofol. Therefore, candidates were expected to provide a definition of the determinants of elimination half-life and its mathematical model with factual data representative of propofol."
- "Factors that affected hepatic clearance of propofol in particular liver blood flow, severe liver disease, drugs and age should have been mentioned. Enzymatic activity has little influence in the face of the high hepatic extraction ratio of propofol. Similarly, factors affecting volume of distribution at steady state like body fat content should have been mentioned."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates who mentioned the effects of individual patient variability, hypothermia and critical illness on elimination half-life gained extra marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates presented irrelevant information such as indications, comparative kinetics with thiopentone and lengthy description of propofol kinetics by infusion."
