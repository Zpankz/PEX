title: "Briefly describe the difference between a single twitch and a tetanic contraction in a skeletal muscle fibre. Include in your answer the physiological basis for the development of a tetanic contraction."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2004
sitting: B
question: 14
passRate: 54
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question required an understanding of the physiological basis of a single twitch versus a tetanic contraction. In particular, it was expected that the answers made reference to the following concepts with regards a tetanic contraction: The requirement for repetitive stimulation, The importance of the frequency of the stimuli, The difference between incomplete tetanic contraction and complete tetanic contraction, The critical frequency required for tetanic contraction and its relationship to the single twitch duration for that fibre, That the contractile mechanism of skeletal muscle has no refractory period"
- "Candidates also earned marks for outlining the sequence of events from motor nerve action potential to muscle depolarisation and subsequent contraction."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Some candidates included a comparison with cardiac muscle action potential and its important differences regarding the question of tetanic contraction."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The most common errors related to confusion regarding what is summating or fusing in a tetanic response. This mainly was in relation to whether it was the action potential or the contractile response or both that were summating in tetanic type contractions."
