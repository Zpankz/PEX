entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2004
sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 48
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points that would gain a pass were: A description of the site of release of renin, The main stimuli that lead to the release of renin, including a reduction of systemic blood pressure and extracellular fluid, an increase in sympathetic stimulation and a decreased delivery of solutes to the macula densa, The cleaving angiotensin I from angiotensinogen by renin, The conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by the action of angiotensin converting enzyme, mainly by contact with pulmonary endothelium, A description of the main functions of angiotensin II, including vasoconstriction, alteration of glomerular filtration rate, direct action on the renal tubules and stimulation of aldosterone secretion, The ability of angiotensin II to inhibit the secretion of renin, This process leading ultimately to conservation of sodium and water."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional information that attracted further marks included: Detailed information about the process of renin secretion, Describing other stimuli for renin secretion over and above those described above, Explaining the site of synthesis of angiotensinogen, A description of the size, structure and half-lives of renin and the various subtypes of angiotensin, Other functions of angiotensin II, over and above those described above, The relative potency of angiotensin III, More detailed descriptions of the intimate processes and interactions of the system."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common mistakes or omissions included: Confusion over the exact cells that secrete renin, Inexact descriptions or omissions of the interrelationship of renin to angiotensin, Confusion over the way solute load reaching the macula densa affects renin secretion, Incorrect associations with the process of tubuloglomerular feedback, Very detailed and often correct descriptions of the actions of aldosterone and vasopressin, at the expense of the required information."
