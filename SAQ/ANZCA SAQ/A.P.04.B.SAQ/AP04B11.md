title: "Briefly explain how oximetry can be used to estimate the partial pressure of oxygen in a blood sample."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2004
sitting: B
question: 11
passRate: 31
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question required integration and application of knowledge about oximetry and the oxygen haemoglobin dissociation curve. Candidates were expected to briefly cover how an oximeter measured haemoglobin saturation in a blood sample, the Beer Lambert law either as a formula or as a written description and the link between haemoglobin saturation and partial pressure of O2 via the oxygen haemoglobin dissociation curve with some common values."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better candidates also described the assumptions and the inaccuracies made in the link between haemoglobin saturation and partial pressure of O2, eg shift of the oxygen haemoglobin curve with changes in pH, pCO2, temperature, 2,3 DPG, the difficulty in deducing pO2 when haemoglobin is fully saturated due to the flat upper portion of the oxygen haemoglobin curve."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common mistakes included writing about the Clark electrode, oxygen content of blood, discussion of pulse oximetry and its inaccuracies, applying the effects of other types of haemoglobin on pulse oximetry to co- oximetry of a blood sample and claiming that oximetry measured the oxygen in the blood directly."
