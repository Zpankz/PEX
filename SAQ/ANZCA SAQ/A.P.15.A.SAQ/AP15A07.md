title: "Briefly outline the effects of sevoflurane on skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscle tissues. Include how these effects are mediated and their clinical significance"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2015
sitting: A
question: 7
passRate: 38
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question lent itself to breakdown into manageable parts: The effects of sevoflurane on each muscle type, the mechanisms relevant to each of the tissue effects, and the clinical significance of those effects."
- "To score well, candidates needed to emphasise relaxant skeletal muscle effects and atypical effects characterised chiefly by MH."
- "An appreciation of the types of smooth muscle - vascular and non vascular, in addition to the clinically unique relevance of specialised circulations such as the cerebral vasculature was a prerequisite for a high score."
- "It was necessary to describe the effect on cardiac muscle specifically rather than on the circulation in general as this tended to result in a confused answer that failed to distinguish vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle effects."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Too many candidates consumed time rewriting the question or providing lengthy details of sevofluraneâ€™s pharmaceutic and kinetic properties for which no credit could be obtained."
- "Similarly, therapeutic interventions to address the clinically adverse effects of sevoflurane were not awarded marks."
