title: "Outline the role of carbon dioxide in the maintenance of ventilation."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2015
sitting: A
question: 2
passRate: 29
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to point out that as a product of metabolism, carbon dioxide (CO2) provides a key link in the control loop that matches ventilation with metabolic rate to maintain a stable PaCO2 level."
- "It was expected that the elements of this control loop and its negative feedback nature were described."
- "In particular, the central and peripheral chemoreceptors with their relative contributions, the central controlling by the respiratory centre in the brain stem, the ultimate effect on minute ventilation via the respiratory muscles and the consequent changes to PaCO2."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Describing factors that influence the gain and threshold of this system such as PaO2 (both increased and decreased), anaesthesia, sleep, and blood pH were rewarded."
- "Discussing the blunted nature of the ventilation response at low and high PaCO2 also gained marks."
- "Drawing the graph of ventilation versus PaCO2 gained marks only if drawn correctly."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common mistakes included: confusing the location of the central chemoreceptors, reversing the rapidity of response between central and peripheral chemoreceptors, writing an equation showing PaCO2 inversely proportional to ventilation then drawing a graph that demonstrated a direct relationship between ventilation and PaCO2 but not explaining that these related to different parts of the control loop, stating that CO2 could not cross the blood-brain barrier but hydrogen ions could."
- "Marks were not awarded for: Describing how CO2 is carried in the blood, Explaining how CO2 influences the oxygen haemoglobin dissociation curve."
