title: "Discuss factors influencing the recovery and reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2015
sitting: A
question: 13
passRate: 34
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Specifically, candidates were expected to describe the effects of volatile anesthetics, magnesium, calcium channel antagonists and aminoglycosides on the release and response of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction."
- "A good answer needed to include the mechanism, direction and magnitude of effects."
- "In addition, the dose of rocuronium given and the duration since last dose administered would have major effect on the recovery and reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block."
- "Candidates should also mention the effects of anticholinesterase and use of ?-cyclodextrin."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Majority of candidates provided details on the general pharmacology of rocuronium."
- "This is unnecessary and inevitably reduced the time that was available to score points that are essential to this question."
