entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2015
sitting: A
question: 8
passRate: 83
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A pass mark required at least 5 classes of drugs to be listed with their accompanying mechanisms of action."
- "It was necessary for candidates to realize that the oral route and drugs only given that way would not be available, as was the urgency of treatment rather than including slower onset agents."
- "In particular it was expected that intravenous and volatile anaesthetics would be included in the list, along with opioids."
- "Specific antihypertensive such as selective beta blockers, nitrovasodilators, alpha 2 agonists and alpha 1 antagonists were required."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Marks were awarded to those utilizing and specifically mentioning drugs to treat inadequate depth of anaesthesia and analgesia as well as the specific anti-hypertensive agents."
- "Structured answers where drugs were grouped according to actions generally facilitated the awarding of marks, although in some instances this led to missed opportunities for individual drug mechanisms of action."
- "Extra marks were awarded for including magnesium, labetalol, calcium channel blockers and centrally acting agents."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many answers included extraneous material which was not awarded marks by the marking guide such as details about how blood pressure is generated or the end results of untreated hypertension."
- "There was also some confusion about the actual mechanism of action of the vasodilators GTN and SNP."
