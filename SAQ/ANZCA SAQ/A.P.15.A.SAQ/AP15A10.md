title: "Outline the physiological changes that may explain why an otherwise well patient may have a reduced urinary output intraoperatively."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2015
sitting: A
question: 10
passRate: 21
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question required candidates to explain the physiological reasons which contribute to a commonly encountered clinical problem and as such required quantification of a normal and reduced urine output, with an explanation of the glomerular, tubular and collecting duct systems and neuro-humoral controls involved in the normal production of urine."
- "A subsequent logical discussion of how pre-renal, renal and post renal perturbations of these could result in low urinary output resulted in higher marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates readily identified decreased perfusion through hypotension and/or myocardial depression as contributory. However adequate descriptions of renal autoregulation were less frequent."
- "Many candidates concentrated on all the possible causes of intra-operative hypotension, rather than describe how glomerular filtration, tubuloglomerular feedback and other mechanisms may lead to oliguria."
- "Comments regarding pathological conditions did not gain marks, since the question specifically stated the patient was otherwise well."
- "Many answers gave significant weighting to surgical misadventure (renal , ureteric , bladder and urethral trauma) which, although possible, is more uncommon than the normal physiological response to stress."
