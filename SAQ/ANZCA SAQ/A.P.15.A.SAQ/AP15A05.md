title: "Sevoflurane and fentanyl are a common anaesthetic drug combination. Discuss pharmacological reasons why it is useful to use them together."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2015
sitting: A
question: 5
passRate: 15
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To pass this question candidates needed to recognize that these drugs complement each other in terms of providing balanced anaesthesia and that they have synergistic actions with regards to their CNS depressant actions."
- "Synergism allows a reduced dose of each drug to be administered reducing the adverse effects associated with these drugs when given in isolation at a higher dose."
- "Detail regarding these concepts as well as specific examples of how they facilitate decreased adverse effects was expected."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better candidates used correctly labelled isobolograms to enhance their answer and noted the cost savings as well as provided examples of the benefits of the combination in surgical subspecialty groups, e.g. obstetrics- fentanyl reducing the dose of sevoflurane which can cause uterine atony."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The most common error made was to provide a table detailing often a considerable number of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and then failing to relate this to the question."
- "Several candidates provided detail regarding situations where the drug combination was not helpful and this did not attract merit."
- "Several candidates incorrectly asserted that the combination of drugs decreased the rate of PONV of either agent alone."
- "A considerable number of candidates falsely stated that fentanyl did not possess any sedative or anaesthetic properties."
