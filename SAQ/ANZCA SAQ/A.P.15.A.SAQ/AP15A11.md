EC_expectedDomains:
- "A brief statement describing the intention of patient controlled analgesia (PCA) to provide effective and safe analgesia in the perioperative pain period provided a good point from which to discuss of the relative advantages and disadvantages of morphine compared with fentanyl for this purpose."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Factual listing of the opioidsâ€™ chemical classifications, presentation, bioavailability, mode of action and potency did not answer the question and did not score marks."
- "Descriptions of alternative opioids or routes of administration did not contribute to marks."
- "When mentioned, differences in cost, patient preference, possible drug error or substance abuse were often overstated."
- "Lists of pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences between fentanyl and morphine did not result in a pass mark unless accompanied by discussion of how onset of effect, time to peak effect, duration of action and active metabolites might influence the ability to deliver safe and effective perioperative analgesia."
