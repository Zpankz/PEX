title: "Describe the determinants of venous return and the effect general anaesthesia would have on these."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2015
sitting: A
question: 14
passRate: 43
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Better organised answers tended to recognize that the question was in two parts and therefore explained the physiological determinants of venous return first."
- "Candidates used these principles to discuss how pharmacological agents, positioning, surgical interventions, e.g. pnuemoperitoneum, and positive pressure ventilation altered the volume of blood returning to the right atrium per unit time."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A pictorial representation of the venous return vs. right atrial pressure curve was useful to demonstrate changes in venous resistance and mean systemic filling pressure and, when drawn and labeled correctly, this gained extra marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates did not recognize that stroke volume per se is not a determinant of venous return and that cardiac output although linked and interdependent is also not a direct determinant of venous return."
