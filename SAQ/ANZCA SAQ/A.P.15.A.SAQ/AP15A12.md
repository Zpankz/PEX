title: "Describe the time course between an intravenous injection of a general anaesthetic agent to loss of consciousness. Explain the delay using pharmacokinetic principles."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2015
sitting: A
question: 12
passRate: 24
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question is in two parts and asks the candidate to describe and explain each stage of the time course to onset of anaesthesia."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Marks were awarded for graphs depicting the plasma and effect site concentrations vs time together with typical levels at which loss of consciousness would occur."
- "Explanations using pharmacokinetic compartment modelling together with discussion about equilibration rate constants between compartments attracted marks."
- "Discussion about determinants of movement between compartments using Fick’s Law of Diffusion also attracted marks."
- "Marks were awarded for an explanation of the effect site concept."
- "A description of the role of the effect site equilibration rate constant (keo) and equilibration half-life (t1/2keo) in the delay in onset was expected."
- "Extra marks were also awarded for discussion about how different intravenous anaesthetic drugs differ in their pharmacokinetic characteristics that lead to differences in onset time."
- "Changes in physiological or pathological states that affected pharmacokinetics attracted bonus marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common omissions were descriptions of each stage in the time course."
- "Explanations about the effect site concept and equilibration rate constants were commonly mistaken."
- "General discussions about a drug’s pharmacokinetic profile not related to its onset time did not attract marks."
