title: "What are the physiological consequences of decreasing functional residual capacity by one litre in an adult?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2015
sitting: A
question: 9
passRate: 43
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To achieve a pass, candidates were required to define FRC, and explain the majority of following points in terms of a reduced FRC – oxygen store, lung compliance, airway resistance, work of breathing, pulmonary vascular resistance, FRC falling below closing capacity, low V/Q with increased physiological shunt and hypoxaemia."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Appropriately labelled diagrams which were relevant to the points being described, attracted higher marks."
- "When considering the consequences of decreasing FRC by 1 litre, it is essential to consider its initial volume."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates should note that listing the normal functions of FRC, followed by a description of a reduced FRC wasted time and resulted in the same information being written out twice with no extra marks."
- "Vague terms like “V/Q mismatch” or “compromised breathing” gained no marks."
- "Many candidates confused dead space with shunt."
- "Others were confused about gas trapping (this is not the cause of atelectasis as FRC falls below closing capacity)."
- "Many candidates wrote at length about the role of FRC in preoxygenation, at the expense of gaining marks with other, equally important points."
- "Treatment strategies aimed at increasing FRC were not relevant to the question."
