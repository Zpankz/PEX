title: "Compare and contrast the effects of general and neuraxial anaesthesia on thermoregulation."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2015
sitting: A
question: 15
passRate: 41
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Anaesthesia impairs thermoregulation in a dose dependent manner, leading to hypothermia in the perioperative period, and marks were awarded for details of how these modes impair thermoregulation."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Graphs of the triphasic response garner additional marks, as did the graph of the widening of the intertheshold range with GA."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates did not comment on the magnitude of the changes with different modes of anaesthesia."
- "Many candidates were not aware that neuroaxial anaesthesia has a central effect, and of the absence of a plateau phase in combined anaesthesia."
