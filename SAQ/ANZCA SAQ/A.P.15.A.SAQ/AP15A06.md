title: "Describe the role of baroreceptors in the control of systemic arterial pressure."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2015
sitting: A
question: 6
passRate: 52
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Answers that achieved a good mark contained information about high pressure baroreceptors and their locations, how mechanoreceptor firing pattern changes with arterial blood pressure, neural pathways to the CNS, a summary of how central integration occurs modulating sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow and the effect on heart rate and systemic vascular resistance."
- "Also required for a complete answer was information about low pressure baroreceptors on the venous side of the circulation which tend to have a longer term effect on blood pressure by affecting hormones controlling intravascular volume via the kidney."
- "High pressure baroreceptors have a more immediate effect to counter acute changes such as those resulting from postural changes."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra credit was given for describing how baroreceptor reflex arcs could be tested with a Valsalva manouevre, the role baroreceptors play in the Bainbridge and Bezold Jarish reflexes and the effect and reversibility of chronic hypertension."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Describing the response to both an increase and then a decrease in arterial blood pressure did not earn more marks- a note that the physiological responses follow the same pathways but are opposite in these situations demonstrates understanding without consuming valuable time."
- "Many candidates described the effect of atrial naturetic peptide but then did not cover the renin-angiotensin/aldosterone system or vasopressin."
- "Detailed description of the effects of these hormones and their synthetic pathways was not required."
