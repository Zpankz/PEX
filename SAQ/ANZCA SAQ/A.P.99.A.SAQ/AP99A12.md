EC_expectedDomains:
- "The explanation of Fade should have included discussion of pre-junctional nicotinic receptors involved in a positive feedback loop with AcetylCholine (ACh) being blocked by the non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking agent resulting in reduced production of ACh vesicles and therefore less vesicles available for release."
- "The explanation of Post Tetanic Facilitation required some discussion of temporarily increased mobilisation of ACh vesicles into the pre-junctional area for ready release as a result of tetanus."
