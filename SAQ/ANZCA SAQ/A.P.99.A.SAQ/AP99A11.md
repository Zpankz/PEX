title: "Briefly compare and contrast the clinical pharmacology of atropine, hyoscine (scopolamine) and glycopyrrolate."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 1999
sitting: A
question: 11
passRate: 42
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences were discussed fairly well."
EC_extraCredit:
- "As far as structure-activity relationships went, most candidates identified the fundamental differences between atropine and hyoscine, and glycopyrrolate."
- "Historical aspects were not well covered. Some candidates mentioned the sources of atropine and hyoscine in nature, but very few mentioned the use of atropine with ether or hyoscine with Omnopon."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "There were two main problems: 1. Inadequate attempts to compare and contrast the pharmacology of the three drugs; and 2. Consideration of only one aspect of the pharmacology (eg. pharmacodynamics)"
- "Remarkably, only about half the candidates stated that these drugs act at muscarinic receptors. Very few identified the drugs as competitive antagonists. The candidates should be very careful not to omit core information such as this - planning would help."
- "However, very few talked about isomers and the relationship of the drugs to the ionic site on the receptor. Only three candidates attempted to draw the structures."
- "Toxicity was also frequently discussed, however, many candidates incorrectly stated that \"central cholinergic syndrome\" was a problem."
- "Many candidates failed to mention doses and a surprisingly large number did not mention the use of these drugs in antagonising neuromuscular blockade."
