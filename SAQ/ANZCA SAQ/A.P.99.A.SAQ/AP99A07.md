title: "Describe the autonomic innervation of the heart, and the direct effect of autonomic stimulation on cardiac function."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 1999
sitting: A
question: 07
passRate: 59
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Anatomical knowledge was required of the neural innervation of the heart, site of ganglia, pathways to the heart and differences between the left and right sides of the body."
- "The identity of the neurotransmitters was relevant as well as the receptors activated."
- "The cardiac tissues are specialised and the effect of neural stimulation differs on sinoatrial node, atria, atrioventricular node, Purkinje cells and ventricular myocytes."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Many of the better answers used this information to structure their answer and succinctly present a large amount of information on the effects of stimulation."
- "The sequence of events following receptor activation was well handled."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many answers were more suited to a question on the effects, on the heart, of adrenergic and cholinergic receptors without distinguishing between the effects of neural stimulation and blood borne agonists."
