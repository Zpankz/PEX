title: "Explain the significance of plasma oncotic pressure in capillary fluid dynamics."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 1999
sitting: A
question: 08
passRate: 75
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The osmotic pressure exerted by the unfiltered proteins obviously required definition in relation to the other Starling forces acting across the capillary membranes."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Answers that scored well used some or all of the following, to explain the significance of the plasma osmotic pressure: • Comparison of forces in different capillary beds • Quantification of forces. Allowance was made for the different values by different authors in the standard texts • Explanation of significance of filtration and reflection coefficients • Effects of altered osmotic and hydrostatic pressures • Lymphatic function"
- "This was successfully done by those who passed, usually with the aid of the Starling pressures equation common to the standard texts."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates who failed either did not answer the question, or made significant errors, demonstrating limited understanding of plasma protein osmotic pressure and its function in capillaries."
