EC_expectedDomains:
- "This answer required precision with terms."
- "The best way to describe the transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide was in a narrative form, explaining each effect eg. the Bohr effect on the maternal side then on the foetal side."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good answers also included the PO2, PCO2 and pH values in the maternal and fetal circulation's before and after the placenta."
- "The Bohr and Haldane effects were defined accurately by nearly all candidates and most confined themselves to the question including little irrelevant information."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates did not make it clear whether they were discussing maternal or foetal haemoglobin, or maternal or foetal haemoglobin oxygen dissociation curves."
- "Uterine and umbilical vessels, when included in diagrams were often wrongly labelled or not labelled at all."
- "The most common mistake was to try and draw the double Bohr effect diagram. This diagram is very complicated and takes a lot of time."
- "Very few candidates drew it accurately or labelled the axes with both numbers and units."
- "Often the diagram was drawn and no attempt made to explain it. The diagram alone is not an adequate explanation."
