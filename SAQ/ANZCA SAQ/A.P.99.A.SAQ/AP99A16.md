entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 1999
sitting: A
question: 16
passRate: 63
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It is therefore reasonable to expect that the candidates should have some knowledge of which agents are included, their effects (both specific to anaesthesia and in general), and the likely physiological consequences following their administration."
- "Areas in which difficulties were encountered included identification of the relevant drugs (eg. clonidine and dexmedetomidine), the sites of significant action (central post-synaptic, peripheral pre-synaptic, spinal cord) and the assignment of anaesthesia utility to various actions and characteristics."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better responses were typically legible, well organised with sites and mechanisms clearly stated, and the effects listed with appropriate comment."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The listing of drug effects does not constitute a description, as the effects may not be clinically useful."
- "Similarly, while the assertion of the high oral availability of clonidine was frequently made, the significance of this to anaesthesia was seldom encountered."
- "Only a few candidates mentioned the problem of prolonged hypotension after clonidine, although many mentioned the transient hypertension with intravenous (IV) bolus dosing."
- "No one mentioned the relatively slow onset of central activity of clonidine or that any of these properties might actually be undesirable for an IV anaesthetic agent."
- "The frequent assertion that bolus dosing with clonidine produces hypertension with tachycardia was disconcerting, as it suggested scant regard for baroreflex responses and little awareness of the effect of alpha-1 receptor stimulation in an intact subject."
- "One further difficulty in interpreting candidatesâ€™ answers was the tendency to use personalised (or local) abbreviations, often without translation; this also was less frequent in the better responses."
