EC_extraCredit:
- "Many received additional credit for discussing dextran 70, dipyridamole, hirudin, ticlopidine, and abciximab."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "However many of the answers failed to demonstrate a clear understanding of their mechanisms of action, and were lacking in precise details."
- "Unfortunately most candidates devoted a large part of their answer to discussing thrombolytic therapeutic agents such as tissue plasminogen activator and streptokinase. No credit could be given for such discussion, as this was not asked in the question."
