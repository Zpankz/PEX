title: "Outline the pharmacological differences between neonates and adults with reference to sevoflurane, vecuronium and morphine."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2003
sitting: B
question: 08
passRate: 42
EC_expectedDomains:
- "In order to pass the candidate needed to make a number of correct statements pertaining to the question."
- "These statements may have included, but are not limited to the following: • definition of neonate. • brief description of sevoflurane, vecuroniun and morphine. • definition of pharmacology-pharmacokinetics/dynamics. • kinetics: key differences between neonate and adult i.e. relativities of TBW, ECFV, comparison of protein binding, renal and hepatic clearance, different ratios of ventilation and FRC. • dynamics: different sensitivities to drugs, permeability of BBB, sensitivity of resp centre. • morphine: in neonate increased t1/2 increased respiratory depression and apnoea. • sevoflurane: more rapid induction in neonate, reduced blood gas solubility, MAC higher in neonate than adult. • Vecuronium: increased Vd reduced clearance increased t1/2 in neonate with increased sensitivity of neuromuscular junction. Net effect dose per kg similar to adult."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common omissions include widespread lack of definitions e.g. of neonate, drugs. No candidate referred to the effect of prematurity on neonatal drug effects."
- "Common errors: Many candidates were unclear as to the relative sensitivities of neonates to non-depolarising muscle relaxants NDPMRs. Many stated MAC for sevoflurane is lower in neonates than adults. There was much confusion over the effect of an increase in Vd for a polar drug. Many candidates stated that morphine was a highly polar drug. Many stated that neonates have increased TBW and increased fat content compared to adults."
- "Many answers appeared incomplete; suggesting that time management may have been an issue."
