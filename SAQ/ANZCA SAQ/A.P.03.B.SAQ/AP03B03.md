entityType: SAQ

college: ANZCA
year: 2003
sitting: B
question: 03
passRate: 63
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The answer should have recognized the importance of GABA as a major inhibitory neurotransmitter, and given a description of the distribution and function of GABA and its receptors."
- "A brief description of the neurophysiology of the GABA receptors would have facilitated the subsequent description of how different agents modify the action of GABA at different sites or by different mechanisms."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Only a few answers mentioned non-anaesthetic drugs that affected GABA."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates failed to mention that there were different GABA receptors."
- "Many answers did not clearly distinguish the effect of benzodiazepines from that of barbiturates on the GABA receptor."
- "A list of drugs acting on the GABA receptor would not receive credit if the direction of effect was not indicated."
