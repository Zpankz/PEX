title: "List the potential clinical uses of an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist and outline the limitations of clonidine for each."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2003
sitting: B
question: 06
passRate: 60
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The list of potential clinical uses for alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonists should include the following. Anaesthesia and sedation, pain management, treatment of hypertension, premedication using anti- sialogogue and anxiolytic properties, haemodynamic stability with a decrease in circulating catecholamines and the reduction of intraocular pressure. Additional other clinical indications are in post operative shivering and the treatment of opiate withdrawal syndromes."
- "The limitations of clonidine in these situations relate to its reduced potency as a partial agonist, and long elimination half life. Its use is associated with hypotension and bradycardia which can be a disadvantage in all the previously mentioned clinical uses."
EC_extraCredit:
- "More selective alpha 2 agonists have greater MAC reducing properties than clonidine."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates understood and explained the acute hypertension with bolus injection and rebound hypertension on withdrawal of clonidine."
- "A common omission of many candidates was to not address the limitations of clonidine for each use, or to instead to explain adrenergic receptor molecular pharmacology in great detail."
- "Sedation and dry mouth can be a limitation except where desirable in use as a premedication."
