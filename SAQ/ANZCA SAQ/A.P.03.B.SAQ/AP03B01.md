title: "Draw and label, on the same X â€“ Y axis, FA/FI curves for the following halothane concentrations in oxygen, showing a 30 minute period from starting administration. (a) Halothane 1%, subject breathing spontaneously. (b) Halothane 6%, subject breathing spontaneously. (c) Halothane 6%, subject paralysed and ventilated. With reference to the major factors determining the shape of FA/FI curves explain the differences between A and B, and A and C."

EC_expectedDomains:
- "Most candidates started the three curves from the origin satisfactorily."
- "Most candidates recognised the significance of the concentration effect on the rise in alveolar concentration."
- "Most candidates recognised the rapid and sustained rise in the FA/FI which would occur during controlled ventilation with 6% halothane."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Some candidates correctly mentioned the mild reduction in cardiac output which would be seen with 6% halothane which would augment the rise in FA/FI."
- "Better answers included the effect of IPPV and 6% halothane on cardiac output, which is profoundly reduced."
- "Some candidates who clearly had difficulty with the curves went back to first principles, describing the various factors on FA/FI which earned valuable marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "However the rise in FA/FI is in fact more rapid for curve (a) rather than (b) to the end point at thirty minutes."
- "However the effect is more modest on the FA/FI ratio, and textbooks discuss this effect where ventilation is controlled."
- "6% halothane is a profound respiratory depressant in the unstimulated patient and this overrides the concentration effect that most candidates quoted."
