EC_expectedDomains:
- "An overview of the role of baroreceptors in controlling blood pressure was expected. The high pressure baroreceptors react via a negative feedback arrangement to rapidly regulate blood pressure changes by changing cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. The low pressure cardiopulmonary receptors have a role in long term blood pressure control by regulation of blood volume."
- "Other points expected were: • Afferent pathways. • Central integration, and the reciprocal balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic system • Efferent pathways and effects, including hormonal."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common omissions were to not describe the low pressure baroreceptors at all, or to describe the sympathetic response without mention of the parasympathetic."
