question: 05
passRate: 86
EC_expectedDomains:
- "All candidates noted the analgesic and anti-pyretic actions of the drug, and the fact that it has little or no anti-inflammatory activity."
- "With regard to the drugâ€™s toxicity, all candidates had a basic understanding of the mechanisms involved in its adverse effects on the liver."
- "Again the section on management of paracetamol toxicity was generally well handled with all candidates aware of the role of N-acetyl cysteine and the use of nomograms to predict the likelihood of liver damage."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates who showed evidence of more extended reading and listed alternative theories such as COX-3 inhibition or inhibition of 5HT reuptake at the spinal cord level were given credit."
- "Hepatic toxicity was the main focus of most respondents, and extra marks were awarded to candidates who were able to list other (less common) adverse effects, such as allergic reactions, skin rash and renal impairment."
- "In this part, extra marks were awarded for those who remembered that simple strategies can, in some circumstances, be important in limiting paracetamol toxicity. Such interventions to reduce drug absorption include the administration of activated charcoal and gastric lavage."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most were able to name the reactive intermediate produced (N-acetyl-p- benzoquinoneimine) although there were a number of inventive spellings."
