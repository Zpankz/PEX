EC_expectedDomains:
- "Important concepts expected were: • The identification and separation of discussion about sodium chloride and associated water (i.e. saline) and \"pure\" water regulation. • Description of the ability and associated mechanisms for production of either hypo- or hyper tonic urine relative to plasma. • Identification and discussion of the role of ADH within this process."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers: • Discussed the threshold and gain for hypo-osmolarity vs. hypo volemia. • Set the role of the kidney within the broader scope of water homeostasis."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common errors or omissions included: • Many answers failed to address the question as asked. • Terms such as water, volume and fluid depletion were used in ambiguous ways. • Directionless relationships e.g. a change in X causes a change in Y. • Failure to discuss how dilute urine is produced."
