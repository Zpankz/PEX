title: "Briefly describe the potential causes of a difference between measured end-tidal and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2003
sitting: B
question: 11
passRate: 43
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The answer required consideration of both patient factors, and those errors and limitations of the equipment and techniques used to monitor carbon dioxide both in the expired gas and arterial blood."
- "Equipment problems expected to be included were leaks and occlusions, effect of sampling site and other gases, and calibration errors."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The effect of alveolar dead space on the difference between end-tidal and arterial CO2 was recognised by most candidates, and many included satisfactory explanations of the causes and potential underlying pathologies, gaining extra marks."
- "The commonly observed clinical effect of delayed alveolar emptying with slow rise in expired CO2, leading to failure to obtain a true plateau, was usually overlooked, but attracted extra marks when included."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This area was overlooked completely by many candidates, leading to the low pass rate."
