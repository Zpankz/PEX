question: 16
passRate: 61
EC_expectedDomains:
- "There were several important points that were often best dealt with by appropriate diagrams. • The central role of the hydrogen/potassium ATPase. • Receptors for gastrin, acetylcholine, and histamine. • The role of the vagus. • Multiple stimuli both enhancing and inhibiting acid secretion that many divided into cephalic, gastric, and intestinal factors."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Points attracting higher marks included a clear understanding that the stomach fluid is extremely acidic and that the parietal cells must actively secrete hydrogen ions against a considerable concentration gradient."
- "Very few mentioned the role of canaliculi in inserting proton pumps into the cellular membrane when the parietal cells are stimulated."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The answers to the second part on control were often better than the first part on mechanism. Some candidates only answered the second part."
