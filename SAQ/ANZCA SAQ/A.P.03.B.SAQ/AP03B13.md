entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2003
sitting: B
question: 13
passRate: 64
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Also expected was an outline of the relative contributions of the upper and lower respiratory tracts, the relationship between lung volume and AWR (best demonstrated graphically), the concept of laminar and turbulent airflows and their effect on AWR (including a version of the Hagen- Poiseuille equation and Reynolds number), the differing relationships between AWR, driving pressure, flow and airway calibre in both turbulent and laminar flow states, and examples of physiological factors that effect AWR (e.g. bronchomotor tone, respiratory rate, dynamic airways compression)."
- "Better answers included a definition of Airways Resistance (AWR), invoking a version of Ohms law and correctly ascribing units (either SI units or more commonly cmH2O/L/sec) and giving some idea of a normal value."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common errors included: • Not mentioning units or wrong units (e.g. mmHg/L/min). • Incorrectly stating that the “driving pressure” is intrapleural-alveolar gradient rather than mouth- alveolar. • Incorrect versions of the Hagen-Poiseuille equations or Reynolds number. • Not explaining the relationship between airway calibre, turbulent flow and AWR. • Discussing lung compliance instead. • Confusing the Lung Volume-AWR relationship with the Lung Volume-PVR relationship and stating therefore that AWR is lowest at FRC than at TLC. • Ignoring the role of the upper airway in AWR. • Wasting time on an exhaustive classification of all Pathological and Pharmacological factors which effect airway calibre."
