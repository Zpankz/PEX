title: "Explain the effects of intermittent positive pressure ventilation on cardiac output."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2019
sitting: A
question: 1
passRate: 54
EC_expectedDomains:
- "In order to obtain a pass, candidates had to correctly identify the changes in more than one chamber of the heart, e.g. to identify the differences between the cardiac output changes in the right heart and the left heart, and how the two are inter-related."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better candidates were able to explain the various cardiac output determinants, the changes with both phases of respiration and the overall cardiac output effects."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates demonstrated an understanding that intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) is the reverse of spontaneous ventilation, and involves an increase in intrathoracic pressure to force gas into the lungs. However, many candidates forgot that IPPV is non-continuous, and that there are changes to the cardiac output in both the inspiratory and expiratory phases."
