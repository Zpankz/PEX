EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question addresses a core pharmacology topic in anaesthesia. A good answer required a brief explanation of the principles of target-controlled infusions (TCI) and effect-site targeting of propofol."
- "A multi-compartment kinetic model for propofol is fundamental to understanding this question. The three-compartment model was frequently cited but the accompanying figures were often drawn incorrectly, particularly with respect to the effect site. In their discussion of the three- compartment model, many candidates mentioned drug distribution but then failed to apply this concept to the operation of TCI systems."
- "In basic terms, TCI devices deliver a variable-rate infusion to achieve and maintain a constant (calculated) target concentration. The initial component of the infusion is conceptualised as a bolus because it is rapid and brief. Importantly, bolus dose calculations are governed by the volume of the central compartment."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good answers described the difference between plasma and effect-site targeting and correctly explained the concept of plasma overshoot."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many answers discussed propofol TCI in terms of single-compartment kinetics, even after first presenting the multi-compartment model."
- "Many answers failed to convey this point, while some answers incorrectly invoked the volume of distribution at steady state. Following the initial bolus, the ongoing infusion rate is calculated to take into account the loss of propofol from the central compartment due to both distribution and elimination. This results in an infusion rate that decreases over time (as long as the target concentration remains unchanged). There was a good deal of confusion in this area."
