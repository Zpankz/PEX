EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates who scored well addressed each of the components of whole blood (red cells, Hb, 2,3-DPG, white cells, platelets, plasma proteins/coagulation factors, electrolytes/acid-base, dissolved gases, additives)."
- "They “explained” rather than listed the changes, and provided detail of the magnitude and time course."
- "A number drew tables showing the changes during each week of storage, then explained the underlying causes of these changes."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates who failed did so because they omitted major components of whole blood."
- "Several candidates wasted valuable time writing about the effects of massive transfusion, which was not required."
- "Others did not answer the question, preferring to state that “whole blood is no longer used” and then to describe the storage of packed cells, fresh-frozen plasma and platelets."
