title: "Outline the pharmacological effects of vasopressin."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2002
sitting: B
question: 8
passRate: 79
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question asked for a description of the pharmacological uses of vasopressin. Information relating to these aspects rather than physiological characteristics of the endogenous ligand was therefore given preferential weighting."
- "Candidates should have mentioned the peptide nature of vasopressin and hopefully comment on the implications for administration. Peptides typically have extremely low oral bioavailability due to intestinal proteases."
- "Candidates should have discussed the different clinical effects and indications for vasopressin and DDAVP."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Generally there was a good standard of explanation of sub-cellular events and mediators."
- "Additional marks were awarded for synergistic activity with catecholamines."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Commonly omitted was the synergistic activity with catecholamines."
- "Although vasopressin will afford water retention in diabetes insipidus it is preferable to use DDAVP to avoid vasoconstriction."
