title: "Explain the physical principles of ultrasound imaging."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2002
sitting: B
question: 14
passRate: 25
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected were how ultrasound waves are generated; their passage through tissues (eg. conduction velocity, reflection, attenuation); recording of reflected waves and processing (eg signal noise ratio, gain, modes of display); and the Doppler effect."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were awarded for factors affecting resolution (frequency, wavelength, attenuation, artifacts), and the role of transoesophageal echocardiography in avoiding technical limitations in transthoracic imaging."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common errors included stating that ultrasound is electromagnetic radiation, and that increasing amplitude always improves resolution."
