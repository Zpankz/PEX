title: "List the physiological factors which increase respiratory rate. Include a brief explanation of the mechanism by which each achieves this increase."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2002
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 55
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question was quite specific in requiring a list of physiological factors followed by a brief explanation of each factor."
- "It was expected that the effects of hypoxia, hypercapnoea, and acidosis would receive most attention."
- "In addition it was expected that at least two other factors would be mentioned (eg exercise, voluntary control, depression of respiratory centre, pulmonary stretch reflexes)."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates neglected to mention that hypoxia and hypercapnoea are synergistic in their effect on increasing respiratory rate."
- "Others made vague statements linking the effects of PaO2, PaCO2 and pH."
- "Some candidates produced detailed descriptions of respiratory control mechanisms which were not required."
- "Many candidates were confused about pulmonary stretch reflexes, which act primarily to limit or prevent hyperinflation, and are less important for controlling respiratory rate."
