title: "Outline the influences of pregnancy on pharmacokinetics."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2002
sitting: B
question: 1
passRate: 39
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Answers framed around the structure of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion performed better."
- "The effects of pregnancy on oral absorption should have included a discussion of gastrointestinal motility, nausea and vomiting and gut blood flow."
- "The opposing effects of the changes in ventilation and cardiac output on the uptake of volatile agents should have been presented."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The differential effects of oestrogen and progesterone on liver enzyme activity were discussed by some."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "It was clear from a large number of answers that candidates who structured their answers around the physiological changes of pregnancy, a more familiar topic, performed poorly. This was not because of factual errors, but rather omission of important areas of pharmacokinetics (eg absorption)."
- "The effects of increased cardiac output on transdermal and intra muscular routes of administration were infrequently discussed."
- "Most candidates discussed the reduction in pseudocholinesterase with pregnancy but few mentioned that this has minimal effect on the dose of suxamethonium because of the increased volume of distribution."
- "Candidates generally mentioned the effect of increased renal blood flow and renal clearance on drug elimination."
