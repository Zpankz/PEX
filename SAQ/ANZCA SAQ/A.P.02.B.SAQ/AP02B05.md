title: "Outline the possible reasons for prolongation of paralysis induced by an intravenous dose of 1 mg.kg-1 of suxamethonium. Briefly indicate the consequences of such a prolonged block."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2002
sitting: B
question: 5
passRate: 60
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points were as follows: • Suxamethonium 1 mg/kg is a routine dose. Phase 2 block from overdose therefore is unlikely • Suxamethonium is metabolised by pseudocholinesterase. Alterations in the concentration or activity of this enzyme can cause prolongation of suxamethonium action. • A discussion of acquired alterations in concentration or activity (i.e. liver disease, pregnancy, drug interactions etc). Note that these do not often result in clinically signficant prolongations in suxamethonium action. • A discussion of the inherited alterations in concentration or activity, including the genetics, incidence, effect on duration of action, investigation with dibucaine number and other tests • The duration of action of suxamethonium can also be altered by other agents or diseases with pharmacodynamic effects. • Consequences including the need for ventilation and sedation in a suitable environment, monitoring of neuromuscular function, possible treatments, investigation of patient and family and implications for future anaesthesia."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common mistakes included discussion of the clinical indications and other side-effects of suxamethonium and omission of information about consequences of prolonged block."
- "Many candidates omitted to discuss one of the three main causes (i.e. inherited, acquired or pharmacodynamic interactions)."
