EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected in the answer were: • The different types of carbon dioxide absorbent with differing likelihoods of interaction with volatile agents. • Specific interactions with: - sevoflurane, producing compounds A – E - desflurane, enflurane and isoflurane, producing carbon monoxide - trichloroethylene, producing dichloracetylene, phosgene - halothane, producing difluorovinyl compound • The influence on these reactions of: - temperature - hydration of the absorbent - concentration of the volatile agent • The potential toxicity of the various products of the interactions • The practical relevance of these interactions in clinical anaesthesia"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Credit was also given to those who mentioned the ability of carbon dioxide absorbents to absorb volatile agents, with the possible consequences of: • Slowing of anaesthesia induction • Release of absorbed volatile agent to a subsequent case."
