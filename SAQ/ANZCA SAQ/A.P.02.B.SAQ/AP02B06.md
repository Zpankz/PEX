EC_expectedDomains:
- "The key elements of a successful answer were clear definitions of each term and a discussion of their features and mechanisms."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Overall those who stuck to the topic and provided brief notes on both tolerance and dependence achieved a good mark."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Decreased potency rather than decreased efficacy is generally seen with opioid tolerance."
- "Many candidates described a lack of tolerance to respiratory depression when tolerance to analgesia occurs. This was in contradiction to the common finding of tolerance to analgesia, euphoria and respiratory depression being much more marked than that for constipation and pupillary constriction."
- "While the majority highlighted the relevance of tolerance and dependence in heroin addicts few highlighted the similar importance in chronic pain patients on oral opioids."
