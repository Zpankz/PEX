title: "Draw a graph comparing the ratio of inspired to alveolar concentrations during the first half hour of administration for nitrous oxide, isoflurane, and halothane. Outline reasons for observed differences between the agents and indicate the effects of increases in alveolar ventilation and cardiac output."

EC_expectedDomains:
- "Reasons for the observed differences between the specified agents include the influences of different concentrations, blood/gas partition coefficients and the effects of the agents on alveolar ventilation and cardiac output."
- "For all agents, increased alveolar ventilation results in more rapid rise of the alveolar to inspired concentration ratio, whereas increased cardiac output reduces the rate of rise of alveolar concentration."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A single candidate inverted the ratio and accurately plotted the equivalent time-course of inspired to alveolar concentrations, gaining full marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The wording of the question created some confusion, as inhaled anaesthetic uptake is dependent upon the rate at which the alveolar approaches the inspired concentration, graphically represented as the time-course of the ratio of alveolar to inspired concentrations."
