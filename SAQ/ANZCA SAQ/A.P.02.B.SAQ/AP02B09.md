title: "Draw a pressure volume loop for the left ventricle in a normal adult. Outline the information that can be obtained from such a loop."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2002
sitting: B
question: 9
passRate: 67
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected were an accurate pressure volume loop, with the phases named and the points of valve opening and closing marked."
- "In addition, an outline of the information gained from the loop was expected, such as stroke volume, ejection fraction, left ventricular end diastolic volume (as a measure of preload), left ventricular diastolic pressure/volume relationship (as a measure of elastance), left ventricular end systolic pressure/volume line (as an indicator of contractility), and area within the pressure/volume loop (as a measure of stroke work)."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A common omission was not including simple information eg. naming the phases of the loop and indicating where the valves open and close."
- "Stroke volume and ejection fraction were often forgotten in favour of complicated elastance lines."
- "A common mistake in the loop was to mark the aortic valve opening at a higher pressure than at which it closed. Also, the diastolic curve often had correct volumes but incorrect pressures."
