title: "Describe the ideal properties of agents used for sedation using two examples."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2011
sitting: A
question: 04
passRate: 69
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Points expected for a pass: Listing the ideal attributes of a sedation agent."
- "Pharmacodynamic qualities should include high therapeutic ratio, minimal cardiovascular and respiratory depression, amnestic and analgesic qualities"
- "Most discussed the examples of midazolam and propofol, comparing them to the ideal qualities and/or to each other."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers demonstrated understanding of the pharmacokinetics, why organ independent metabolism was better, how certain drugs had a short CSHT due to redistribution or high metabolism."
- "Some recognised that propofol had a lower therapeutic ratio as compared to midazolam, as the dose required to produced sedation was close to that for producing general anaesthesia."
- "Additional marks were given for mentioning drug interactions, increased sensitivity with age and pain on injection with propofol."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Those that used only one example or neglected to talk about pharmacokinetics were less likely to gain enough marks to pass."
- "Other mistakes were to regurgitate all known facts about the two agents, without reference to what would make them ideal for use as a sedation agent."
