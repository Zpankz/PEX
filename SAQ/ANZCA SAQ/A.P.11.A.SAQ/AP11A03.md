title: "Outline the effects of liver failure on drug kinetics and dynamics."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2011
sitting: A
question: 03
passRate: 31
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Most candidates were able to point out that drug metabolism (predominantly phase 1 reactions) is decreased with liver failure."
- "Important pharmacodynamic changes should include an increase in sensitivity of anesthetic agents with hepatic encephalopathy, and down regulation of beta adrenoreceptors in liver failure."
EC_extraCredit:
- ""
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Few could indicate the change is only significant in drugs with a low hepatic extraction ratio (e.g. benzodiazepines)."
- "A number of candidates spent a significant amount of time describing the change in protein binding of drugs."
- "Unfortunately, the direction and magnitude of change in drug effect were vague in most answers."
- "Common omissions include that associated renal failure (hepatorenal syndrome) may decrease renal clearance of drugs and their active metabolites, and that the production of plasma cholinesterase is reduced with liver failure and this may affect metabolism of suxamethonium."
