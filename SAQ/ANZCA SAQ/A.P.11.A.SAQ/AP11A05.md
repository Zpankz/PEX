EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most answers included only cardiovascular drugs such as sodium nitroprusside whose specific use is in the management of a hypertensive crisis."
- "However, most answers did not include drugs that anaesthetists use every day to manage this problem, such as sevoflurane, fentanyl, propofol and Local Anaesthetic agents. This was the main reason for the low pass rate."
- "Another common error was to overlook the mechanism of action for lowering blood pressure. Reporting that “beta receptor blockade lowers blood pressure”, is too imprecise to score points in a post-graduate specialty examination."
