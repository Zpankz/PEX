title: "Describe the factors that oppose left ventricular ejection."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2011
sitting: A
question: 10
passRate: 25
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected included: recognition that afterload opposes left ventricular ejection, definition of afterload, the contribution of SVR and factors determining SVR, and the application of the law of LaPlace and the use of the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to describe factors which contribute to afterload."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for the role of the aortic valve, aortic compliance, IPPV, and for demonstrating understanding of the relative changes in pressure and tension within the ventricle during systole."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "As previously, this question was misinterpreted by many candidates and answered as for determinants of left ventricular ejection fraction: descriptions of preload and contractility attracted no marks."
- "Common mistakes included repetition, vague or non-directional statements, and incorrect formulae."
