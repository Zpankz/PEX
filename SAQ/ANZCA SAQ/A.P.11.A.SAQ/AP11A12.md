EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers included a brief description of a skeletal muscle fibre and its contractile mechanism, definitions of a single muscle fibre twitch and titanic contraction, an explanation of the difference between the membrane electrical refractory period and fibre relaxation time and the implications of each, the reasons re-stimulation within fibre relaxation time results in additional contraction, the role of calcium, the impact of relaxation times for different fibre types on the frequency required to create a titanic contraction (with example values for each), and the differences between single twitch and titanic contractions with respect to the reasons that relaxation occurs, force achieved, and energy requirements."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common mistakes included providing excessive detail about synaptic events or excitation-contraction coupling and missing the important points above, describing summation and tetany as electrical events rather than mechanical events, and writing about the use of a nerve stimulator."
