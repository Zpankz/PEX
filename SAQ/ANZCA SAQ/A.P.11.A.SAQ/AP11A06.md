title: "Write a brief outline on the pharmacology of remifentanil."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2011
sitting: A
question: 06
passRate: 55
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A clear pass required some sort of logical approach to the description of drug pharmacology incorporating Drug chemistry, Uses, Pharmaceutic information including presentation and recommended doses, A proposed mechanism of action, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics"
- "Key chemistry description needed to highlight phenylpiperidine derivation from fentanyl, synthetic preparation, unique ester linkage."
- "There are multiple uses of this agent - simply stating “as a component of TIVA” gained marks but did not gain maximum credit."
- "Pharmacodynamics was not well described - the requirement was for a logical organ system approach outlining key effects in each system."
- "Candidates needed to describe/explain remifentanil has a fast onset and why this is so, that offset is dependant on metabolism not redistribution, organ independent high capacity metabolism and metabolic products."
EC_extraCredit:
- "To score well, both bolus and infusion dosing had to be given."
- "The bulk of the available points were allocated to a description of the agent’s pharmacokinetics reflecting its novel features."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Few candidates correctly stated any mechanism of action, fewer correctly identified mu selectivity, and fewer still the mechanism of mu agonism induced analgesia."
- "Whilst some recall of volume of distribution, elimination half life, and context specific parameters was necessary, a clear pass required more than a list of uninterpreted numbers."
- "Candidates who stated only that “the effects are those of morphine” could not score well"
