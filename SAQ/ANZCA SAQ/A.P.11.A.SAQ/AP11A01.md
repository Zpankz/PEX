title: "Describe the factors which increase the risk of systemic toxicity with amide local anaesthetic agents."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2011
sitting: A
question: 01
passRate: 34
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question requires an understanding that systemic toxicity is due to an excess in the plasma concentration of local anaesthetic, which is dependent on the rate of absorption into the systemic circulation, drug distribution and clearance."
- "Candidates were expected to know the relative toxicities between different amide anaesthetics."
- "An understanding of why certain amide anaesthetics are more toxic than others based on factors such as lipid solubility, chirality, intrinsic vasoconstrictive properties and sodium channel affinity were expected."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Successful candidates organised their answers into drug factors including pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic factors and patient factors."
- "Quantifying the differences gained extra marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Listing factors such as pKa, lipid solubility and protein binding without a clear explanation of how these contributed to toxicity did not gain high marks."
- "Drug distribution was poorly understood especially in the context of patient factors such as age and cardiac status."
- "Repeating a concept under different headings such as pKa, degree of ionisation and ion trapping in the foetus or acidotic patient did not gain more marks."
- "Defining the CNS/CVS ratio without explaining why different amide anaesthetics have different values did not gain marks."
- "Local anaesthetics bind to many proteins which affects systemic toxicity. Binding to plasma proteins alters drug distribution, affinity for receptor proteins affects dwell time and binding to tissue proteins affects release of drug into the systemic circulation."
