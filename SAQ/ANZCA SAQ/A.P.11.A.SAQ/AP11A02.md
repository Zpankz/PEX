EC_errorsCommon:
- "Discussion of neuropathic pain, opioids, and non-drug treatments did not attract marks."

- "When discussing adverse effects avoid statements such as, ‘many side effects’ or ‘many interactions’, without providing additional detail."
- "Writing ‘sedation’ as the only adverse effect of tricyclics did not attract marks."
- "Many answers contained a long detailed description of simple analgesics, and only a limited discussion of other drugs used for the treatment of neuropathic pain."
