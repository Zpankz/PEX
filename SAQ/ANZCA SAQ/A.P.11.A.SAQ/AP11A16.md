title: "Explain the difference between viscosity and density. Outline the effects of changes in viscosity and density on the flow of gases and liquids."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2011
sitting: A
question: 16
passRate: 72
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Points required for a pass were to demonstrate some understanding of the definitions of viscosity and density, the differences between laminar and turbulent flow and their dependence on viscosity and density respectively, and the factors that might influence the transition between laminar and turbulent flow."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were given for illustrative examples taken from physiology or anaesthetic equipment, understanding of flow-resistance relationships, and deeper understanding of the underlying physics (e.g. inertial vs. resistive forces)."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A common fault was that many candidates erroneously thought that density was defined as mass per unit area."
