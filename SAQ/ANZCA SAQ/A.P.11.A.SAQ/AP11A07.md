EC_expectedDomains:
- "Successful candidates structured their answers with a list of advantages and disadvantages from a pharmaceutic, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic perspective."
- "The main advantages that were expected were: rapid onset and offset, second gas effect, reduction in MAC, and analgesic effect."
- "The main disadvantages that were expected were: reduction in FiO2, diffusion hypoxia, expansion of closed air spaces, PONV, increased CBF/ICP, and the long term effects of prolonged or chronic exposure, e.g. megaloblastic anaemia, subacute combined degeneration of cord, and possible teratogenicity."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for clear explanations about why nitrous oxide is inappropriate as a sole agent, and other concepts, e.g. second gas effect, and expansion of gas spaces."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common mistakes were to discuss nitrous oxide in isolation rather than as part of a general anaesthetic."
- "There were misconceptions about the mechanism of analgesia, which is described in the prescribed texts."
- "There were inadequate explanations about how nitrous oxide is “cheap”, and very few candidates discussed the set-up and maintenance costs associated with nitrous oxide."
