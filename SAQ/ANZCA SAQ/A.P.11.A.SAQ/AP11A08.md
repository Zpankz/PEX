title: "How may drugs potentiate the action of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants at the neuromuscular junction?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2011
sitting: A
question: 08
passRate: 5
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Drug interactions are relevant as there is a risk of failure to reverse neuromuscular blockade and residual paralysis."
- "Drugs may interact either at the nerve terminal or the receptor to reduce the effect of acetylcholine (ACh) in competitively overcoming the block."
- "Presynaptically there are at least three mechanisms that might reduce the release of acetylcholine (ACh): Reduced AMP/ATP synthesis – frusemide, Blockade of presynaptic ACh receptors – volatiles, Blockade of calcium channels – calcium channel blockers, magnesium, aminoglycosides, volatiles"
- "Postsynaptically there are several mechanisms that interfere with ion flux through the nicotinic receptor: Direct blockade of the ACh receptor – volatiles, aminoglycosides, quinidine, other neuromuscular blockers, Desensitization block (binding to non-receptor sites) – volatiles, barbiturates, local anaesthetics"
EC_extraCredit:
- "The following answer would have gained a very high mark:"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The most common error was irrelevance: detailed descriptions of the physiology of neuromuscular transmission and a classification of non-depolarizing relaxants."
