title: "Describe the physiological effects of general anaesthesia on temperature regulation"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2011
sitting: A
question: 14
passRate: 44
EC_expectedDomains:
- "In order to pass this question, candidates were expected to discuss temperature regulation with induction, maintenance, and recovery from general anaesthesia."
- "An understanding of dose dependent, agent dependent, and age and sex dependent factors were required."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for describing the differences between elderly patients and neonates, for a correct description of the role of non-shivering thermogenesis, and for a description of the additional effects of neuraxial blocks in conjunction with general anaesthesia."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates were confused by the differences between the interthreshold range and the thermoneutral zone."
- "Very few candidates mentioned temperature regulation during the recovery phase."
- "Graphs were often incorrectly drawn, and the thermoneutral zone was frequently incorrectly defined."
- "Some candidates gave a detailed account of the normal physiology of thermoregulation, rather than answering the question as relevant to anaesthesia."
- "The main reason for candidates failing this question was insufficient core knowledge."
