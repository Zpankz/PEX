EC_extraCredit:
- "Good answers included an overview of the unique properties of the esterases and their pharmacological implications followed by a discussion of pseudocholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase) and non-specific plasma and red cell esterases."
- "Overview: Hydrolysis of ester bonds with drug inactivation by esterases High capacity/clearance enzymes produced in liver and red cells Non organ dependent drug metabolism with generally inactive metabolites Exceptions including laudanosine and salicylic acid Pseudocholinesterase; Metabolism of succinylcholine, mivacurium, and ester local anaesthetics Potential problems with congenital and acquired dysfunction Common congenital pseudocholinesterase variants and clinical implications Acquired dysfunction including physiological, pathological and drug interactions Non specific plasma esterases; Metabolism of remifentanil, atracurium High capacity systems little effected by hepatic metabolism High clearance of remifentanil with infusion and independent short context sensitive t1/2 Atracurium and laudanosine Red Cell esterases; Metabolism of esmolol and possibly remifentanil High clearance of esmolol with short duration, titratable"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some problems with answers included; extensive discussion of acetylcholinesterase and detailed discussion of pseudocholinesterase with none of plasma and red cell esterases."
