title: "Outline the main biochemical events involved in noradrenergic transmission, and how these may be altered by the use of MAO (mono amine oxidase) inhibitors ?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2000
sitting: A
question: 11
passRate: 57
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points covered in the better answers included:-
    • The structure of noradrenaline.
    • A concise outline of the synthesis of noradrenaline from phenylalanine via tyrosine, dopa and dopamine, including the sites of these processes and the enzymes involved.
    • The storage function of the granulated vesicles and the calcium ion dependent mechanism(s) of noradrenaline release via exocytosis into the synaptic cleft in response to an action potential.
    • The interaction between noradrenaline and post-synaptic receptors.
    • The breakdown in the synaptic cleft (and elsewhere) or noradrenaline by catechol-o-methyl- transferase (COMT) to form normetanephrine.
    • The presynaptic and post-synaptic uptake of noradrenaline, most of the noradrenaline from the presynaptic uptake being reincorporated into the granulated vesicles.
    • Metabolism by mono-amine-oxidase(MAO) within the nerve terminal to form 3,4 dihydroxymandelic acid, which is converted by COMT to 3 methoxy-4-hydroxy-mandelic acid (vanillymandelic acid,VMA).
    • Inhibition of MAO results in reduced breakdown and increased activity of adrenaline, noradrenaline and serotonin at relevant sites throughout the nervous system.
    • The differentiation of sites and functions of MAO A and MOA B, and their specific inhibitors.
    • Reversible (eg moclobemide) and irreversible inhibition of MAO.
    • The biomechanical events underlying the various adverse reactions to MAOIs precipitated by eg. Sympathomimetics, amphetamines, tricyclics, pethidine, and tyramine rich foods.
    • The blood pressure lowering effected of a MAOI-induced false transmitter (octopamine).
    • Comments on the putative basis for the antidepressant effects of MAOIs."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Several answers included extensive accounts of the physiological functions subserved by noradrenergic transmission but made little or no reference to the relevant biochemical events."
