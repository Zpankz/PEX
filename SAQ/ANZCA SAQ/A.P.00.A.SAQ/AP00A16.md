title: "Briefly describe the factors that determine skin penetration by local anaesthetics. What is an eutectic mixture? Briefly describe the formulation and pharmacology of EMLAÂ® cream."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2000
sitting: A
question: 16
passRate: 73
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A large number of answers included a list only, without further explanation, thus scoring poorly on this section."
- "Although most candidates correctly referred to the fick equation, simply writing it down without explanation did not constitute adequate coverage."
- "Furthermore, very few noted that a large surface area was not needed if a small area of anaesthesia was desired."
- "In fact, some comments about uptake and blood flow suggested that many candidates felt that EMLA cream was intended to achieve therapeutic systemic concentrations (this was not a question about trans-dermal opiates; fentanyl in particular)."
- "Many candidates referred to \"protein binding\" without indicating which proteins were they referring to."
- "Plasma protein binding plays little, if any role in the trans-cutaneous action of EMLA."
- "No candidate made use of the structure-solubility relationship of local anaesthetics (2 mentioned amethocaine or benzocaine, but failed to qualify these inclusions adequately), nor did many explain non-ionised fractions well, several suggesting that ionisation increases with increasing pH."
- "Please note that potency correlates with lipid solubility (and toxicity), but is not an independent determinant of absorption."
- "Generally, it appeared that few candidates understood much of the chemistry of these drugs or the definition of an eutectic mixture."
- "Local anaesthetics are not the only compounds to form eutectic mixtures."
- "In fact only 2 candidates correctly defined the mixture as being the composition at the eutectic point."
- "EMLA cream is a CREAM (as written in the question), not an ointment, etc."
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Knowledge of the constituents, the droplet formation, and the free base content were required to score highly."
- "Most candidates mentioned metHb formation from prilocaine and the low systemic toxicity potential for this preparation."
- "Several candidates confused basic concepts such as melting and boiling points."
- "Details of onset and duration were also poorly covered."
