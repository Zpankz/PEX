title: "What is a normal value for pulmonary vascular resistance? Outline physiological factors that influence pulmonary resistance."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2000
sitting: A
question: 3
passRate: 49
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The first part of the question specifically asked for the normal range of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)."
- "The factors that influence PVR are those that affect resistance to flow anywhere in the body, as well as factors particular to the lung. ie. Resistance is directly proportional to blood viscosity (which is influenced by haematocrit) and inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius (given that flow is laminar and that length is constant)."
- "An outline of at least two of these factors was required for a pass."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Values using dyne/sec/cm5 were also accepted."
- "Even if exact values were not known, it was important to indicate that PVR is much less (1/8-1/10) than systemic vascular resistance."
- "Additional marks were given for more detail on the mechanism of these effects."
- "Credit was given for mentioning the lesser effects of carbon dioxide, pH, and endogenous vasodilators and vasoconstrictors."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common mistakes included presenting only a single value instead of normal range, and using incorrect units."
- "Some candidates completely ignored this section."
- "Most candidates ignored the effects of blood viscosity."
- "Detailed discussion of West's zones was not required."
- "Few candidates explained that pulmonary vascular impedance is a more appropriate term for the pulmonary circulation due to the relatively greater pulsatility."
