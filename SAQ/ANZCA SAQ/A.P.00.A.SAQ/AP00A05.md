title: "Describe the important determinants of work of breathing in an adult human at rest. Explain how to minimise work of breathing."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2000
sitting: A
question: 5
passRate: 50
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers defined the work of breathing and gave correct SI units (Joules)."
- "A well-labelled pressure-volume graph was an ideal way to clearly and concisely demonstrate an understanding of elastic and non-elastic/resistance work, potential energy stored elastically for passive expiration, and energy dissipated as heat."
- "Percentage contributions to overall work on overcoming elastic forces, airway resistance and tissue viscous resistance enhanced answers."
- "A figure for O2 consumption by the respiratory muscles was expected."
- "Better answers used graphic representation of the work and respiratory rate relationship for elastic work, resistance work and overall work."
- "Comparing work of breathing and optimal respiratory rate in situations of increased resistance work and increased elastic work enhanced answers."
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The second part of the question related to minimising the work of breathing and was particularly poorly done."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A number of candidates appeared to be unaware of the 'work of breathing' as a concept."
- "A number of candidates wrote very \"clinical\" answers emphasising patho- physiology, ICU management principles and lists of drugs useful to treat increased airways resistance. This was not required."
- "Simply writing down Poiseiulle's equation or Reynold's number with no effort to relate them to work of breathing was also unhelpful."
- "Mentioning FRC and the role of surfactant was useful but not to the exclusion of a discussion of other factors."
