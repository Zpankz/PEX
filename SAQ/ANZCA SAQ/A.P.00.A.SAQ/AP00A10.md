EC_extraCredit:
- "The better answers were structured into sections on kinetics, dynamics, and toxicity."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This was a pharmacology question, not a question about the physiology and biochemistry of pain."
- "Nevertheless, many candidates gave unnecessarily elaborate details of arachidonic acid metabolism and cyclooxygenase inhibition."
- "Although these answers were not penalised for this additional information, many easy marks were lost because basic pharmacological details such as onset and offset of action, and dosage were not included."
- "Many candidates mentioned that paracetamol has a mild antiinflammatory action, yet then wrote extensively about peripheral inhibition of prostaglandin."
- "Explanations of paracetamol toxicity were generally good."
- "Some candidates incorrectly attributed the renal toxicity of paracetamol to the same mechanism to that associated with NSAIDs."
