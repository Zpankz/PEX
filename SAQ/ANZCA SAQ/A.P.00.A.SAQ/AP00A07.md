title: "List the hormones that regulate renal tubular reabsorption and describe their action and site of action."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2000
sitting: A
question: 7
passRate: 70
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question required listing the hormones that act directly on the tubule cells to regulate reabsorption of the glomerular filtrate ie. aldosterone, angiotensin 2, atrial natriuretic hormone, antidiuretic hormone, and parathyroid hormone."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Locally released hormones, and hormones that indirectly affect reabsorption by, for example, affecting renal perfusion, were listed by some and were accepted if their action was appropriately explained."
- "Calcitonin was accepted, even though its physiological role in the kidney is unclear."
- "There were generally good descriptions of actions, particularly of aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone, at the cellular level."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "There was less certainty and accuracy in describing site of action within the tubule (eg proximal vs distal tubule vs collecting duct)."
- "Parathyroid hormone, when listed, was correctly described by few candidates."
- "There was confusion between it and 25-hydoxyvitamin D, calcitriol and calcitonin, by many candidates."
