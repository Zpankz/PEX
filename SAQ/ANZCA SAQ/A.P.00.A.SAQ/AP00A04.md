EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected in the answer were:-
    • A Single twitch is the response to a single stimulus, whereas a tetanic contraction is the response to repetitive stimulation above a critical frequency.
    • The critical frequency depends on the single twitch duration in that muscle fibre.
    • Repetitive stimulation before complete relaxation causes summation of contractions, and repetitive stimulation before any relaxation causes tetanic contraction.
    • The physiological basis of tetanic contraction is the maintenance of a high Ca++ concentration in the myoplasm, as repetitive sarcolemmal depolarisation causes Ca++ to enter the myoplasm faster than it is pumped out into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
    • The contractile mechanism has no refractory period.
    • The tetanic force is up to 4 times greater than that of a single twitch.
    • Tetanic contraction continues until the repetitive depolarisation ceases or until fatigue occurs."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Other points which gained marks included:
    • A description of the mechanism by which sarcolemmal depolarisation causes Ca++ to enter the myoplasm.
    • Mention of high ATP consumption during tetanus.
    • A brief description of the role of Ca++ in electromechanical coupling.
    • Actin-myosin bridge formation (and hence shortening) continue as long as the Ca++ concentration in the myoplasm is high."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Several candidates mis-read the question, assuming it to be about the response to use of a peripheral nerve stimulator in the operating theatre, while in fact the question was about normal neuromuscular physiology in the intact human."
- "Failure to discuss the role of calcium was a stumbling block for some candidates."
