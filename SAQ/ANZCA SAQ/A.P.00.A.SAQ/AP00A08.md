entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2000
sitting: A
question: 8
passRate: 17
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected were a discussion of the structure of haemoglobin and the fate of all three of its constituents ie; iron, haem and globin."
- "Details about haemoglobin's survival time and the mechanisms of breakdown of the constituents were required, as well as the relevant transport proteins, and enzymes involved in key reactions."
- "Some comments about the fate of bilirubin should also have been included, such as its secretion into bile, and its enterohepatic circulation."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A common misconception was that globin is directly reincorporated into haemoglobin."
- "In addition, the enterohepatic circulation was often incorrectly described."
- "However, the main error was failure to discuss all three of haemoglobin's constituents, or to describe the breakdown processes in sufficient detail."
