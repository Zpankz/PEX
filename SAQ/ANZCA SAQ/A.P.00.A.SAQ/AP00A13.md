title: "[OLD] Briefly describe correlation and simple linear regression, and explain their differences. What assumptions are common to both?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2000
sitting: A
question: 13
passRate: 70
EC_extraCredit:
- "Many candidates successfully used a set of scatter plots to aid their description of these two concepts."
- "The formula for a straight line [y= a + bx] was noted along with the phrase 'least squares method' in describing simple linear regression."
- "While discussing the assumptions common to both, most candidates mentioned that data must be normally distributed."
- "Additional marks were given to the few candidates who indicated that a distribution free correlation coefficient, the Spearman's rank correlation, is applicable to non- parametric data."
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The examiners' expectation was for an explanation of the concepts rather than detailed knowledge of the statistical equations and their derivations."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The slope of this line [b] which is called the regression coefficient was however commonly confused with the Pearson's correlation coefficient [r]."
- "While r describes the strength of the association, b does not."
- "They will have the same sign for a given data set but are otherwise completely separate concepts."
- "However, in many cases the use of an equation is most appropriate in quickly explaining the 'concept'."
