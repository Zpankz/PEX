title: "Briefly describe the factors that influence the partial pressure of oxygen in mixed venous blood?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2000
sitting: A
question: 2
passRate: 56
EC_extraCredit:
- "The following areas were explored in the better answers. A definition of \"mixed venous\" including sampling site. The relationship between PO2 and O2 content in mixed venous blood. For any mixed venous O2 content the mixed venous PO2 is dependant on the shape of the haemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve. A right shifted HbO2 curve increases mixed venous PO2."
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Also expected was the relationship between mixed venous O2 content, arterial O2 content, oxygen consumption and cardiac output."
- "All are related by modification of the Fick equation: CvO2 = CaO2 - VO2/Q. Any factor which affects CaO2, VO2 or Q will ultimately affect mixed venous PO2 . Of note is the reciprocal relationship between oxygen extraction and cardiac output. As cardiac output falls, O2 extraction increases and mixed venous PO2 falls. Arterial O2 content is also an important determinant of mixed venous PO2."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "It was apparent that candidates had difficulty in sourcing from the relevant areas of respiratory and cardiovascular physiology to present an adequate answer."
- "Most candidates wrongly stated the reverse."
- "Some candidates interpreted this as a question on the HbO2 dissociation curve and the factors that shift it. This was only a small part of the answer."
- "However, some candidates produced a lengthy description of all the factors affecting PaO2 or even drew the oxygen cascade which was not required."
- "A common error was to relate the factors described to the mixed venous O2 content or saturation rather than partial pressure."
- "Terms such as content and concentration were often confused with each other, as were tension and saturation."
