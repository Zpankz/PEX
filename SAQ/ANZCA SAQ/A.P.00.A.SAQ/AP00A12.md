EC_extraCredit:
- "Oxytocin is an endogenous polypeptide hormone released from the posterior pituitary and is available for clinical use in a synthetic form."
- "In the literature there is some dispute as to whether it is an octapeptide or a nonapeptide and either statement was acceptable."
- "The primary actions of oxytocin are on the gravid uterus and breast milk ducts."
- "It has very poor oral bioavailabilty due to inactivation by chymotrypsin as a first pass effect, and must be administered parenterally but can also be used intranasally."
- "Indications for use are augmentation of labour, uterine contraction post delivery, and as aid in lactation."
- "The common side effect seen is vasodilation resulting in flushing and a drop in systemic vascular resistance that produces hypotension and a reflex tachycardia that elicits a net increase in cardiac output."
- "This hypotension can augment that seen with anaesthetic agents and techniques that produce hypotension."
- "Synthetic oxytocin has very little antidiuretic hormone effect and the syndrome of water intoxication, whilst relevant and important is not a common side effect."
- "It is usually seen after prolonged high dose infusions with significant water infusion, usually in the form of 5% dextrose."
- "There are real risks to foetal well being if the full dose of oxytocin is administered prior to delivery."
- "It is stated in texts that oxytocin infusions antagonise the effect of suxamethonium and that it is inactivated if co-administered with blood transfusion."
