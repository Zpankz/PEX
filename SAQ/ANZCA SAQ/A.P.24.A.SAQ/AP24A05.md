- "[[BT_GS 1.49]]"
- "[[BT_GS 1.31]]"
- "[[BT_GS 1.2]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "GABA-A receptor structure"
- "GABA-A receptor function"
- "interaction of midazolam"
- "interaction of propofol"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail about the receptor"
- "more detail about the binding sites and activity of both drugs, including the different dose- dependent actions of propofol"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "a significant number of candidates did not mention that GABA is the natural ligand for the GABA-A receptor; while others described ligands other than GABA"
- "the function of the GABA-A receptor was not well answered"
- "Some candidates focused on synergism in answering part (b). Synergism refers to the clinical effect of two drugs which follows on from receptor activation. However, some marks were awarded here if the information provided was relevant to the interaction of midazolam and propofol with the receptor. Unfortunately, many candidates who wrote about synergism used graphs which showed infra-additive effects, thereby contradicting their written answer."
- "some candidates wrote about the NMDA receptor"
