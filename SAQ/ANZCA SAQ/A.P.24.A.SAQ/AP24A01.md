title: "Outline the anatomy of the arterial blood supply to the spinal cord."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2024
sitting: A
question: 1
passRate: 44
lo:
- "[[BT_RT 1.23]]"
- "[[BT_RT 1.15]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "one anterior spinal artery arises from the vertebral arteries, and supplies the anterior 2/3 of the cord"
- "two posterior spinal arteries arise from the posterior inferior cerebellar arteries (in most people), and supply the posterior 1/3 of the cord"
- "reinforcement by radicular (segmental) arteries at each vertebral level"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail about the course of anterior / posterior spinal arteries, and the origins and course of the radicular arteries (the artery of Adamkiewicz in particular)"
- "understanding the vasocorona"
- "understanding the potential vulnerability of spinal cord blood supply, with anatomical correlation to events such as clamping the aorta, or vertebral artery dissection"
- "understanding the tracts supplied by the anterior and posterior spinal arteries, with clinical deficits resulting from compromised supply"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "a concerning number of candidates had no knowledge at all of this area of anatomy"
- "few candidates accurately described the origin and course of the artery of Adamkiewicz (or indeed any of the radicular arteries)"
- "many candidates significantly overstated the risks associated with aortic cross clamping"
