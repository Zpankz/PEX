EC_expectedDomains:
- "mechanism of action"
- "variability in response"
- "Type 1 and Type 2 HITTS, with information about each"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail in each section"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "many answers lacked an explanation about how heparin interacts with ATIII, its conformational change, and how this interacts with clotting factors"
- "some answers confused the mechanism of UFH with LMWH or warfarin"
- "many candidates did not attempt this section, or wrote incorrect information"
- "the most common response was “metabolism by heparinases”, and some referred to “genetic variation”"
- "this section was well answered by most candidates, although some were confused between Type 1 and 2"
- "information which did not address the question was not awarded marks"
