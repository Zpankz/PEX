lo:
- "[[BT_PO 1.44a]]"
- "[[BT_PO 1.45]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "pressure volume loop"
- "information obtained"
EC_extraCredit:
- "detail and breadth of answer"
- "explaining indices of preload, afterload, contractility, cardiac work, etc"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "mislabelling of the point which correlates with diastolic BP"
- "showing aortic valve closure occurring at a lower pressure than aortic valve opening"
- "incorrectly drawn afterload and contractility lines"
- "implying that the whole LV elastance line is preload (rather than EDV)"
- "incomplete labelling of x and y axes"
