title: "Explain the physiological processes that cause oliguria in response to hypovolaemic shock."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2024
sitting: A
question: 11
passRate: 53
lo:
- "[[BT_PO 1.70]]"
- "[[BT_PO 1.65]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "sympathetic nervous system"
- "renin-angiotensin system"
- "antidiuretic hormone"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail"
- "fuller understanding of the interaction and overlap between systems"
- "understanding that responses may be triggered by hypotension and/or increased osmolarity, depending on the cause of the hypovolaemia"
- "including aldosterone and ANP"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates started their answer by spending a lot of time (often 1 to 2 pages) explaining the equation for GFR. The answer only required making a link between decreased renal artery pressure, and decreased GFR. The main bulk of the answer needed to focus on the physiological processes which can maximally reabsorb sodium and/or water from the filtrate, to produce a low volume of concentrated urine in response to shock."
- "many answers were superficial or failed to show any integration of the systems which are involved in producing oliguria; and many answers contained errors"
- "many candidates emphasised the vasoconstrictive effect of ATII as the mechanism that decreases GFR – however, the efferent arterioles are preferentially constricted, which helps preserve GFR"
- "systemic vasoconstriction was also emphasised as a major mechanism for oliguria"
- "Many answers began with an extensive discussion of the Starling forces at the glomerulus, which significantly reduced the time available to answer the question that was asked. It is likely that many candidates were misguided in this regard by several of the “model” answers available on line."
