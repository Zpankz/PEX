title: "Outline the pharmacokinetic factors which influence the time taken for loss of consciousness with an inhalational induction of anaesthesia."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2024
sitting: A
question: 4
passRate: 58
lo:
- "[[BT_GS 1.24]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "loss of consciousness occurs when the partial pressure (PP) of an inhalational anaesthetic reaches a threshold level within the brain (effect site)"
- "during induction, inhalational agents move down PP gradients as follows: circuit → lungs → blood → brain (and other tissues)"
- "the factors determining the rate of rise of PP in each of the above was expected"
- "the impact of agent solubility on the rate of rise of PP in blood and brain needed explanation – both in terms of the amount of agent that needs to be dissolved to generate a given PP, and the amount of uptake of the agent into other tissues"
- "understanding the central role of alveolar PP, which is determined by delivery vs. uptake"
EC_extraCredit:
- "detail"
- "understanding the concept of time constants"
- "understanding the time taken for Palv to equilibrate with Pbrain"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "there was widespread confusion about the terms ‘concentration’ and ‘partial pressure’, especially in terms of what is meant by equilibration"
- "Candidates who used ‘ADME’ invariably wrote a poor answer – this framework is suited to IV/oral drug administration. The pharmacokinetics of inhalational agents is described using a model of delivery vs. uptake, centred around alveolar PP."
- "many candidates drew an FA/Fi curve, but this was not then followed by information which showed understanding relevant to the question"
- "it was surprisingly frequent for answers to omit any mention of factors affecting the rise of PP in the circuit (particularly FGF)"
- "although the concentration and second gas effects were frequently mentioned, many candidates had poor understanding, or wrote contradictory information"
- "statements including the expressions ↓ onset or ↑ onset were often unclear (even when giving every consideration to the context of the expression)"
