- "[[BT_RA 1.3]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "drug factors"
- "patient factors"
EC_extraCredit:
- "breadth of answer"
- "detail of mechanisms"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "a large number of candidates failed to mention the two most common and most serious factors resulting in LAST"
- "A frequent error was confusion about the significance of the differing lipid solubilities of amide LAs. While greater lipid solubility correlates with greater intrinsic toxicity, it is not the case that local anaesthetics with high lipid solubility are able to move into the systemic circulation faster. In fact, the opposite is true as highly lipid soluble LAs are sequestered in tissue to a greater degree. This argument was often made by candidates who tried to force their answer into Fick’s law."
- "The addition of bicarbonate to LA solutions is not relevant to the risk of LAST. In fact, it is the presence of acidaemia in the patient which increases the potential for toxicity through increased cerebral perfusion and decreased plasma protein binding of the local anaesthetic."
- "candidates frequently referred to the CC:CNS ratio using incorrect terms and with incorrect descriptions, or were unable to explain what the ratio means"
- "candidates frequently based their answers around Fick’s law, and this seldom led to a strong answer"
- "many candidates completely neglected to consider patient factors which may increase the risk of systemic toxicity – the inclusion of some information from this domain was considered necessary to pass"
