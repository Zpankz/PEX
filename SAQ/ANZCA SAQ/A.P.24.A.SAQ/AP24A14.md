title: "Describe the physiology of the neuromuscular junction. (Do not discuss excitation-contraction coupling)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2024
sitting: A
question: 14
passRate: 54
lo:
- "[[BT_GS 1.35]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "pre-synaptic depolarisation and ACh release"
- "nicotinic ACh receptor and ACh binding"
- "post-synaptic depolarisation"
- "voltage gated Na channels"
- "breakdown of ACh by acetylcholinesterase"
EC_extraCredit:
- "completeness of answer"
- "additional detail (e.g. the fate of acetate and choline)"
- "linking physiology to the structure of the NMJ"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "many candidates provided inadequate detail, or left out a major component of the answer"
- "confusion between muscarinic and nicotinic receptors"
- "confusing nAChR with voltage gated sodium / calcium channels"
- "providing diagrams without labels or explanation"
- "marks were limited by discussing muscle relaxant pharmacology and neuromuscular disorders at the expense of writing enough about this specific area of physiology"
