title: "Compare and contrast the following oxygen delivery devices • standard / basic nasal prongs (NP) • high flow nasal prongs (HFNP)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2024
sitting: A
question: 2
passRate: 39
lo:
- "[[BT_SQ 1.14]]"
- "[[BT_PO 1.41a]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "description of devices"
- "understanding the concept of “fixed vs. variable” performance for oxygen delivery devices"
- "understanding the impact of peak inspiratory flow and respiratory rate upon the performance of NP and HFNP"
- "advantages"
- "disadvantages"
- "flows used and FiO2 delivered"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail or breadth"
- "apnoeic oxygenation"
- "explaining how PEEP is generated by HFNP"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "lack of detail"
- "many candidates either struggled to explain, or had incorrect understanding of, the concept of fixed vs. variable performance with reference to physiological variables and the two devices in this question"
