title: "Outline the differences between the respiratory physiology of a neonate and an adult, using the following headings • control • mechanics • ventilation • gas exchange (Do not discuss the upper airway or intubation)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2024
sitting: A
question: 13
passRate: 30
lo:
- "[[SS_PA 1.24]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "control"
- "mechanics"
- "ventilation"
- "gas exchange"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail – e.g. respiratory muscle fibre type and fatigue, lung volumes, surfactant, airway resistance, mechanical advantage of a high respiratory rate, blood gas values, et.al."
- "including information about premature neonates"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "there were significant errors in understanding of control, with vague comments such as neonatal control is ‘blunted’ or ‘immature’ – few were able to explain the left shifted CO2 response curve, or the biphasic response to hypoxaemia"
- "many answers lacked understanding of the differences in ventilation and compliance"
- "the reasons for a lower PaO2 were rarely explored within the ‘gas exchange’ section – most answers focused on HbF or the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve"
- "many candidates still included upper airway anatomy despite the question specifically excluding this (no marks were awarded for airway anatomy)"
- "many candidates focused their answer on the physiology of the first breath"
