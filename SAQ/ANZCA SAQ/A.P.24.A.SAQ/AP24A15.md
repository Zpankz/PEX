title: "Outline the mechanisms which cause each of the following, after the release of an arterial tourniquet which has been insitu for 2 hours • hypotension • desaturation • hypercarbia"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2024
sitting: A
question: 15
passRate: 43
lo:
- "[[BT_PO 1.47]]"
- "[[BT_PO 1.82b]]"
- "[[BT_RT 1.10]]"
- "[[BT_PO 1.29]]"
- "[[BT_PO 1.79]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "hypotension"
- "desaturation"
- "hypercarbia"
EC_extraCredit:
- "detail provided above"
- "covering all 3 elements of the question"
- "understanding the limitations and time course of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "inadequate explanation for hypotension, sometimes limited to “vasodilation”"
- "failing to consider venodilation, with increased venous capacitance and decreased venous return"
- "only considering the effect on the vasculature within the ischaemic limb, or the systemic vascular effects, but not both"
- "most candidates failed to recognise the principal mechanism for desaturation"
- "many candidates asserted that CO2 is a product of anaerobic metabolism"
- "some candidates attributed the changes to inflammatory mechanisms, citing the production of cytokines, bradykinin, etc."
