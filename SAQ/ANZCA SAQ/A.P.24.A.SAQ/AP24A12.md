title: "Outline the physiological roles of calcium in the body."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2024
sitting: A
question: 12
passRate: 34
lo:
- "[[BT_PO 1.72]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "possible roles include but are not limited to – skeletal muscle contraction, cardiac muscle contraction, smooth muscle contraction, SA/AV node action potentials (phases 4 and 0), cardiac myocyte action potential (phase 2), neurotransmitter release, exocytosis, the coagulation cascade, intracellular second messenger systems, electro-stability of nerve and muscle cell membranes, bone structure (hydroxyapatite)"
EC_extraCredit:
- "breadth of answer"
- "more detail (e.g. the role of calmodulin)"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "many candidates wrote about the regulation/control of serum calcium – this information did not answer the question that was asked"
- "describing the effects of hypo- or hyper-calcaemia did not score marks unless it led to a description of the roles of calcium (but this was rarely the case)"
- "the effects of hypocalcaemia were frequently described incorrectly – hypocalcaemia causes nerve excitability and muscle tetany – this links to the role of extracellular calcium as a membrane stabiliser"
- "candidates quoted wide variations for the intracellular calcium concentration (up to 100 mmol/L) – it is micromolar, which is highly relevant to its role as a biological signal"
