title: "Explain how the kidney handles glucose. Describe the physiological consequences of glycosuria."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2001
sitting: B
question: 6
passRate: 47
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The kidney freely filters glucose and almost completely reabsorbs it in the proximal convoluted tubule. This is an active process, utilising a Na+ co-transport system. Glycosuria causes an osmotic diuresis, and details of the mechanism were expected."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were attracted for discussion of the SGLT 1 and GLUT 2 transporters and their role. A description of the TM and how glycosuria occurs at a level below the theoretical TM also received extra marks. Candidates who explained the effect on the medullary osmotic gradient and the subsequent failure to concentrate urine received extra marks. Some mention of the systemic implications of these effects was also expected."
