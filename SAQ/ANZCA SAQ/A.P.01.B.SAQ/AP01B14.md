EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected were a brief description of histamineâ€™s usual roles, including gastric acid production, central neurotransmission, and vascular tone; and its role in inflammation and allergic reactions. The specific cardiovascular, respiratory and local effects (eg. skin wheal and flare response, pain), specific identification of H1, H2 (& H3) actions, and gastric acid secretion were the main points required."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A specific mention of drug allergy was rarely included. Many candidates provided an unnecessary amount of detail about the synthesis and G-protein mediated mechanism of action of histamine, but minimal information about its effects."
