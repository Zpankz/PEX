title: "Describe the determinants of work of breathing in an adult human at rest."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2001
sitting: B
question: 2
passRate: 72
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected were- that the S.I. unit of work is the Joule, and an explanation of how work is derived (eg. Pressure times Volume) a breakup of inspiratory work into elastic and non-elastic components that elastic work consists of deforming elastic tissue, and overcoming surface tension that non-elastic work consists of overcoming airway resistance and viscous forces that resistance work is performed during inspiration and expiration, but that the energy for expiration is acquired during inspiration the effects on work of breathing due to changes in compliance, airway resistance, and respiratory rate"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for- correctly labelled pressure-volume diagrams with percentage contributions the oxygen cost and efficiency of work of breathing mentioning that energy is also lost as heat"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common mistakes were to write detailed answers on compliance, airway resistance, and patho- physiological conditions. A common omission was to describe expiration as passive, without stating that potential energy is acquired during inspiration and stored elastically to provide energy for expiration."
