title: "Describe the physiological changes that occur in respiratory function during pregnancy."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2001
sitting: B
question: 4
passRate: 60
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Key points expected included changes to the various lung volumes, pattern of respiration, minute ventilation, and the resultant arterial blood gases."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were gained for outlining the various anatomical changes that occur, explaining the physiological implications, and outlining the changes to oxygen flux. Demonstrating understanding of the ramifications of the various changes enhanced answers. For example the reduction in FRC (and therefore the lung O2 stores), coupled with the increased O2 utilization, increases the rapidity of onset of hypoxaemia. Also the arterial gas tension changes enhance placental gas transfer to the benefit of the foetus. A number of candidates wrote in some detail on the clinical anaesthetic implications of the airway and ventilatory changes. This only gained additional marks where clear understanding of the underlying physiology was demonstrated."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common misconceptions included tidal volume decreasing or remaining unchanged, significant rises in ventilatory rate, elevation of PaCO2, reduction of PaO2, increased shunt, and significant reduction in vital capacity."
