entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA

question: 12
passRate: 18
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Intrathecal opioids act initially on spinal opioid receptors, causing presynaptic and postsynaptic effects at a cellular level such as decreased release of substance P. The resultant analgesia is greater for dull pain mediated by C fibres than sharp pain mediated by A-delta fibres."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers compared different opioids, gave some indication of the duration of analgesia and gave more detail on the different side effects."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Urinary retention, pruritis, nausea and delayed respiratory depression are important side effects but few candidates mentioned their expected incidence. Some candidates appeared to list the effects of spinal local anaesthetics and stated that intrathecal opioids would cause significant cardiovascular disturbance. Although meperidine has been used as a sole intrathecal anaesthetic and large doses of other opioids such as sufentanil may have significant local anaesthetic effect, this is not usually the case after small doses of intrathecal opioids. Secondary haemodynamic or other effects occurring because of adequate analgesia were not rewarded. However candidates should note there has been concern about intrathecal opioids in labour and fetal bradycardia. Some candidates discussed epidural opioids, and gave unnecessary detail about transfer of opioids across the dura and systemic absorption. Many candidates wasted time on a detailed comparison of the pharmacology of different opioids. Candidates scored few marks when they listed all the possible effects of opioids without taking into account the intrathecal route and consequent small dose used."
