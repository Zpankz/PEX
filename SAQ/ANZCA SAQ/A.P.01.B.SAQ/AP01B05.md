title: "Describe the structure and function of voltage gated ion channels."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2001
sitting: B
question: 5
passRate: 59
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question asked for a description of both structure and function of voltage gated ion channels specifically. What was sought was evidence of comprehension of the basic functioning of voltage-gated channels. This included knowledge of their dependence on voltage changes for configurational changes, a resulting alteration in specific ion conductance, and awareness of the concept of channel activation and inactivation."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The inclusion of detail on the subunit components and gating mechanisms was variable, and was often restricted to sodium channels alone. Further marks were gained by relating this to specific roles in excitable membranes and organs. Again, quite a few candidates focused solely on sodium channels, but this was accepted if comprehension of the concepts of voltage-gated channels was displayed. Inclusion of details of other channels (e.g. potassium and calcium channels), however, scored additional marks. Some candidates included detail on modulation of receptor function over time, and changes in functioning with drugs/toxins, which gained extra marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "General information on ion channels which did not pertain to voltage gated ion channels did not score marks. Some candidates provided excessive detail at the expense of other areas. The answers to the 'function' component of the question were much more variable."
