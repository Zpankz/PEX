title: "Describe the mechanism of the anticoagulant effect of coumarin derivatives and what determines the onset and offset of effect."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2002
sitting: A
question: 15
passRate: 45
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Most candidates indicated that the anticoagulant effect of coumarins is mediated via vitamin K antagonism and inhibition."
- "An understanding of the different half-life of vitamin K dependent factors, II, VII, IX, X and protein C and S, was essential to explain the delayed onset of action of coumarins."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Important and clinically relevant determinants of onset were rarely mentioned."
- "Most candidates however, identified external supplementation of vitamin K and fresh plasma as ways of accelerating offset of coumarin effect."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "However, most candidates failed to describe the nature of this antagonism (competitive) at therapeutic levels and also to mention the coumarin sensitive step in the recycling of vitamin K and its role in the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues to produce biologically competent factors."
- "The time to peak plasma levels and its relation to biological effect were often omitted."
- "The effect of loading dose, age sensitivity, postoperative relative vitamin K deficiency, level of coagulation factors and albumin levels should have been included."
- "The effect of congenitally high levels of coagulation factors, disease states, enzyme induction, ingestion of vitamin K rich food could have been included but were rarely mentioned."
- "Most candidates mentioned INR as a monitor for warfarin therapy; some gave unnecessary details of INR levels needed for different indications."
