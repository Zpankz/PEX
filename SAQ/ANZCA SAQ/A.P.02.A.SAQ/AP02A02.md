title: "Draw a labelled diagram of a cardiac muscle action potential highlighting the sequence of changes in ionic conductances. Explain the terms “threshold”, “excitability”, and “irritability” with the aid of the diagram."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2002
sitting: A
question: 02
passRate: 56
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The first part of this question required a diagram of a cardiac muscle action potential with labelled axes, normal values, and phases 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 identified."
- "An explanation of the ionic fluxes involved with each phase was expected."
- "Threshold, the level of depolarisation at which a self propagating action potential is generated, was well described and illustrated."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for drawing a diagram showing changes in conductances of Na+, Ca++, and K+."
- "Extra marks were awarded for mentioning that as irritability increases, depolarisation is easier, but there is a decreased gradient and reduced conduction velocity of phase 0."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Excitability and irritability were often confused."
- "A common omission was to describe the ionic fluxes only in terms of membrane permeability, with no explanation of the electro-chemical forces acting on the various ions during the five phases."
- "Few candidates mentioned the effect of K+ on resting membrane potential."
