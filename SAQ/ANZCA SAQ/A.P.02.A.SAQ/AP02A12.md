exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2002
sitting: A
question: 12
passRate: 72
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The \"mechanism of action\" and \"adverse effects\" parts had equal marks available."
- "A bare pass answer in each part could have included - Mechanism of Action: The inhibition of metabolism of arachidonate by cyclooxygenase (COX) to subsequent prostaglandins, together with detail about COX-I & II differences, explaining why these might be exploited with selective COX-II inhibitors. Adverse Effects: Gastric haemorrhage, inhibition of platelet aggregation and renal impairment together with detail about how and when these occur"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were given for greater detail of how the analgesic, anti-pyretic, and anti-inflammatory actions are produced and for non-COX inhibition mediated mechanisms of action."
- "Anti-platelet actions were accepted in either part of the answer but marked only once."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates frequently stated that \"NSAIDs cause asthma\" without further qualification."
