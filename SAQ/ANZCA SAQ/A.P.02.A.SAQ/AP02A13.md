EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected included the following: Pulmonary fibrosis and/or alveolitis is a common serious toxicity estimated to occur in 5 to 15% of patients on chronic therapy."
- "The cause is not known but it has a high associated mortality."
- "There are two presentations – progressive dyspnoea with infiltrates on chest X-ray or an acute onset cough, hypoxia, and dyspnoea that mimics infectious pneumonia."
- "Postoperative patients are at risk of developing adult respiratory distress syndrome particularly if they have been on cardiopulmonary bypass."
- "Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with side effects relating to its multiple sites of action in the cardiovascular system."
- "As a non-competitive blocker of α- and β- adrenergic receptors IV administration induces arteriolar vasodilation resulting in hypotension."
- "General anaesthesia may exacerbate these antiadrenergic effects leading to sinus arrest, AV conduction block, peripheral dilation, hypotension and low cardiac output."
- "Direct myocardial depressive effects are minimal."
- "Bradycardia can occur with chronic therapy and the additive effect of volatile anaesthetics in suppressing myocardial conduction may enhance this effect."
- "Amiodarone prolongs the cardiac action potential, and hence the QT interval, through its suppression of outward K channels."
- "This may lead to life threatening ventricular arrhythmias including torsades de pointes, although the incidence is less than with other class III agents."
- "Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism occurs in 2-4% of patients, and is related to the iodine content of amiodarone."
- "Corneal microdeposits occur in almost all patients receiving long term therapy."
- "Photosensitive skin reactions are quite common, slate grey pigmentation that persists after discontinuation of the drug is more rare."
- "Dose dependent mild increases in liver transaminases are common."
- "Peripheral neuropathy can occur in patients on long term high dosage."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for mentioning the potential role of inspired oxygen levels in this postoperative complication."
- "Additional credit was given for mentioning the pharmacokinetic implications of displacement of drugs such as digoxin from protein binding sites and the potentiation of warfarin."
