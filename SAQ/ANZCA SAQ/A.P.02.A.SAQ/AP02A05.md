sitting: A
question: 05
passRate: 77
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Key concepts expected included the semi-permeable nature of the cell membrane, the uneven distribution of ions/charge across the membrane, the equilibrium (Nernst) potential for each ion (with an explanation of what it means)."
- "Some version of the Goldman Field Equation (or similar), emphasizing the importance of permeability, with a brief explanation of the role of Na/K ATPase in both maintenance of, and a contribution to, the RMP, was also expected."
- "It was also anticipated that some mention of the Donnan effect and its minor contribution to RMP would be made."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Answers were enhanced by including typical resting membrane potentials of various cells (eg Myelinated Axon, Skeletal Muscle, Ventricular Myocyte, Smooth Muscle or Erythrocyte)."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A few candidates wasted time on a discussion of Action Potentials, which was not required."
