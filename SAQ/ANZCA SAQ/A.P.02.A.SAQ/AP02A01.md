title: "Explain how oxygen supply of organs is maintained during isovolaemic haemodilution."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2002
sitting: A
question: 01
passRate: 45
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A satisfactory answer should have indicated that although haemodilution decreases oxygen carrying capacity (by a decrease in arterial oxygen content), oxygen delivery is usually maintained by an increase in cardiac output."
- "These variables are quantified by the oxygen flux equation."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Decreased blood viscosity simultaneously increases venous return and stroke volume and decreases systemic vascular resistance and afterload, all of which increase cardiac output."
- "From Poiseuilleâ€™s law we note that flow resistance is directly proportional to blood viscosity."
- "Other relevant areas include the vasodilation that occurs in organ beds and the mechanisms involved."
- "Also important is the increase in oxygen extraction by most organs and possible changes in the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve that enhance tissue oxygenation."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The decrease in blood viscosity as a result of haemodilution causes many of the cardiovascular changes that occur. This was not mentioned by over half the candidates."
- "Some candidates wrongly indicated that anaerobic metabolism and lactic acidosis (as seen in hypovolaemic shock) occur in moderate isovolaemic haemodilution."
- "Many answers described clinical methods of increasing arterial oxygenation or reducing oxygen consumption which were not relevant to the question asked."
- "Erythropoiesis secondary to increased erythropoietin levels (as occurs in chronic anaemia) was mentioned by many candidates but again has no relevance to this question."
