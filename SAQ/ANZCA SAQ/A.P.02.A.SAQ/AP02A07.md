title: "Outline the principles of a pneumotachograph. What factors affect the accuracy of this device?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2002
sitting: A
question: 07
passRate: 44
EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a pass, an answer should have included most of the following points : • Fixed-orifice device i.e. measurement of pressure drop across a fixed resistance • Design with either a mesh screen or capillaries to encourage laminar flow • With laminar flow there is a linear relationship between flow and ∆P, according to Poiseuille's equation."
- "Accuracy is affected by the following factors, • Humidity and condensation • Temperature • Flow greater than maximum recommended for the particular device • Viscosity of gas measured versus calibrated for"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were awarded for additional relevant information e.g. design features; the low pressure drop (< 1 - 2 cmH2O); the Fleisch screen can incorporate a heater to prevent condensation; There is a range of sizes available (eg suitable for children and adults); if flow is too large for the device chosen then turbulence will result in which case there is no longer a linear relationship between P and Flow; if flow is too low the ∆P may be too small for the transducer to detect."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Several candidates wrote answers on different pieces of equipment, e.g body plethysmograph, capnograph, Bourdon gauge, or others. No matter how correct that information, no marks could be given."
- "Eight candidates wrote nothing at all."
- "Common errors included listing changes in gas density rather than viscosity as important without mentioning that this was only of relevance to calculation of Reynolds' number."
