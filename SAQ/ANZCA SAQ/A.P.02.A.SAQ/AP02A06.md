title: "Explain the physiological processes which cause oliguria in response to hypovolaemic shock"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2002
sitting: A
question: 06
passRate: 72
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The following areas could have been included: Definition of oliguria and hypovolaemic shock; The way that hypovolaemia is detected (role of low and high pressure baroreceptors); The consequent neuro-endocrine responses which affect the kidney, such as activation of the sympathetic nervous system, the role of the renin-angiotensin system and aldosterone, and release of antidiuretic hormone; Influences on glomerular filtration such as renal blood flow, arterial blood pressure, glomerular permeability; Distribution of blood flow within the kidney, intra-renal factors effecting glomerular and tubular function, and the role of the medulla in concentrating urine; Some over-view of the physiological advantage in producing concentrated urine in response to hypovolaemia; Some indication of the relative importance of the concentration process compared to the other factors."
- "Given that the word “shock” was included in the question it was reasonable to include comment about pathophysiology relating to shock and oliguria."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The challenge of this type of question is to succinctly provide a broad overview."
- "Difficulty in achieving high marks generally related to the problem of going into too much detail in part of the answer and omitting other major areas or explanation of concepts."
