EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected in the answer were: • Local anaesthetics vary in their toxicity, toxicity correlates with intrinsic potency. • Systemic toxicity relates to the blood level of local anaesthetic. • Blood levels depend on site, dose and rate administered and other factors such as metabolism. • A description of the sequence of events that occurs with increasing blood levels, the CC:CNS ratio. • Specific examples including a brief discussion of the mechanism of toxicity eg. bupivacaine, cocaine."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Other information that was rewarded included a discussion of factors that predispose to toxicity, maximum dosages, local toxicity and anaphylaxis."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A common error was to imply that toxicity was the same for all local anaesthetics, eg, 'arrhythmias caused by local anaesthetics are difficult to treat'."
- "Serum levels were sometimes listed without reference to a particular agent."
