title: "Define “Venous Admixture”. Briefly explain how venous admixture influences arterial oxygen tension and how an increase in inspired oxygen concentration may affect this."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2002
sitting: A
question: 03
passRate: 46
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected in the answer were: 1. An adequate definition 2. A brief discussion of shunt and V/Q inequality, both physiological and pathological 3. A brief discussion of the contribution of V/Q inequality and shunt to changes in PaO2 4. A differentiation between true shunt and V/Q inequality 5. An explanation of the effect of cardiac output on venous admixture 6. An explanation of the effects of increased FiO2 on true shunt and on venous admixture due to V/Q inequality"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Points that gained extra marks included mention of sources of physiological and pathological shunt and V/Q inequality, the effect of the shape of the Hb saturation curve on the response to increasing FiO2, and mention of extra-pulmonary shunts (normal and abnormal)."
- "A correctly labelled iso- shunt diagram or description of the shunt equation also received extra marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common mistakes included omission of all mention of V/Q inequality."
- "The axes of the iso-shunt diagram were often incorrectly labelled."
