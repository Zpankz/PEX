title: "Outline the factors that determine recovery (offset of action) after ceasing a drug infusion."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2002
sitting: A
question: 10
passRate: 43
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The effect of most drugs is related to the drug concentration at the effect site."
- "Thus recovery is dependent on all the factors that influence the concentration at the end of the infusion, the rate of decline in concentration, and the final concentration that no longer has an effect."
- "The concentration at the end of the infusion will be dependent on the dosing regimen up to that time and the drug pharmacokinetics."
- "Diffusion of drug between the blood and the effect site will be affected by the concentration gradient and the physicochemical characteristics of the drug."
- "Although a few drugs may be metabolised at the effect site, most drugs will have to diffuse back to the blood before elimination."
- "The decline in blood concentrations will be determined by drug clearance and distribution (and factors that alter clearance and volumes of distribution)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Many answers elaborated on the context sensitive half time (CSHT) as an example of the balance between distribution and elimination."
- "The effect site drug concentration required for recovery may be affected by factors such as individual variability, tolerance and drug interactions."
- "Other factors that may influence actual recovery include active metabolites and patient status."
- "A few drugs bind irreversibly to receptors or inactivate them so that the effect long outlasts their measured blood concentration."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many answers listed potential factors without indicating whether recovery would be prolonged or shortened."
- "Many answers were confused about the effect of volume of distribution (Vd)."
- "A larger peripheral Vd may hasten the decline in plasma concentration if the infusion is relatively short."
- "An increase in lipid solubility does not necessarily mean an increase in Vd."
