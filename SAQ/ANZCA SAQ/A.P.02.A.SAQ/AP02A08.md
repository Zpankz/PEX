title: "Describe the physiological factors that contribute to the competence and tone of the lower oesophageal sphincter."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2002
sitting: A
question: 08
passRate: 42
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected included the following:- The lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) at the terminal 4 cm of the oesophagus is characterised by an increased number of nerve cells."
- "It consists of smooth muscle (intrinsic sphincter); which is tonically active, and is under neural control."
- "Acetylcholine leads to contraction of the intrinsic sphincter."
- "The crura of the diaphragm constitute the external sphincter, and are under control of the phrenic nerve."
- "Contraction is coordinated with ventilation and contraction of the chest and abdominal muscles."
- "On swallowing, the LOS relaxes temporarily."
- "The oesophagus enters the stomach at an oblique angle and the diaphragm maintains this angle which forms a pinch valve."
- "The lower oesophagus is in the abdomen and is thus exposed to intra abdominal pressure."
- "Some description of hormonal influences was expected (eg. gastrin, motilin, prostaglandin E2, glucagon, secretin, cholecystokinin, VIP)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for including the following points: The oblique fibres of the stomach wall functions as a flap valve."
- "There is a pressure differential between the stomach and the oesophagus."
- "Barrier pressure is the difference between the LOS pressure and the intra-gastric pressure."
- "The latter is about 10 cm H2O."
- "Normal barrier pressure is about 26 cm H2O (reflux can occur when this pressure falls below 13 cm H2O)."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some candidates listed the hormones without stating how they affect the LOS tone."
- "Most mentioned barrier pressure but some did not state any values."
- "Others discussed pharmacology which was not required."
