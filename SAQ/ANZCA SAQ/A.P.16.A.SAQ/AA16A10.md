title: "Describe the cardiovascular changes that occur with ageing."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2016
sitting: A
question: 10
passRate: 65
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Cardiovascular changes in ageing include effects on cardiac and vascular smooth muscle, the conduction system of the heart, the CVS reflexes, the function of the heart as a whole and its response to exercise and stress. The focus of this question was the normal consequences of aging rather than disease. Key points included a description of the loss of myocytes, elastin and collagen, and subsequent replacement with connective tissue. This results in loss of compliance or increased ‘stiffness’, which leads to a greater reliance on the Frank Starling mechanism to maintain stroke volume. To do this, higher filling pressures are required. There are also compensatory increases in the size of remaining myocytes and left ventricular hypertrophy in response to increases in afterload. Descriptions of increases in systolic blood pressure and pulse pressures together with explanations and were also expected. Descriptions of impairment to the baroreceptor reflex, the conduction system, and the response to exercise scored marks."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were awarded for a description of the increased importance of the atrial kick in the elderly as a proportion of ventricular filling. Extra marks were also awarded for descriptions about increased conduction velocity of pulse wave down the vascular tree leading to earlier reflection of pulse wave from periphery."
- "Bonus marks were awarded for descriptions about endothelial dysfunction, adrenergic receptor sensitivity, and changes to the pulmonary circulation."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The contribution this may make to increased afterload was commonly omitted."
- "Descriptions of changes unrelated to the cardiovascular system did not score marks."
