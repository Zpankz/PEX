title: "Describe the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics and major side effects of amiodarone."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2016
sitting: A
question: 9
passRate: 43
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Relating the K+ channel blocking effects to the action potential and effective refractory period, with some mention of the other mechanisms, would have achieved a pass on this section. Describing the high plasma protein binding, high tissue binding and large Vd, with consequent need for a prolonged loading dose schedule and comment on the elimination kinetics would have earned a pass for the second section."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Full marks required more detail on the various mechanisms, with the overall effects on the AV node, SA node and speed of conduction."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Simply stating the Vaughan-Williams classification is not a description of mechanism of action."
- "Almost every candidate listed corneal micro-deposits as a major side-effect, yet many did not mention the pulmonary complications and those who did rarely commented on their incidence, or their high morbidity and mortality."
- "Many candidates wrote an extensive preamble to their answer, with details on indications, contra-indications and its use in an arrest situation, none of which was asked for. A few candidates confused amiodarone with adenosine and digoxin."
