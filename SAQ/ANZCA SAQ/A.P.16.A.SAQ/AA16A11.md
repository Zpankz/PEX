title: "Describe the respiratory effects of adding positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) to intermittent positive pressure ventilation (PPV)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2016
sitting: A
question: 11
passRate: 1
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Anaesthetists add PEEP to IPPV to ‘recruit lung’, that is, to mitigate the decrease in FRC seen with general anaesthesia and IPPV. A candidate could thus pass by discussing the respiratory effects of normalising FRC. It’s pretty much the reverse of the previously asked question of the effects of a reduction of FRC from normal. Consider the effect of PEEP on • lung volumes, • airway resistance, • the ventilation/perfusion relationship, • lung mechanics, • lung water and • PEEP side effects including barotrauma."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good candidates recognised that PEEP increases FRC with resultant effects on • airway resistance, • lung compliance and • work of breathing."
- "Extra marks were awarded for recognising that the effect of PEEP varies in the base of the lung compared to the apex."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The mechanism of decreased airway resistance and V/Q improvement required explanation. Few candidates explained how the effect of PEEP on lung compliance depends on where the lung sits on its compliance curve."
- "No marks were awarded for definitions of PEEP or IPPV or for describing the effects of pathological states on lung volumes."
- "Cardiovascular effects of PEEP were not asked for except when required to explain V/Q changes and the effect of PEEP on PaO2."
