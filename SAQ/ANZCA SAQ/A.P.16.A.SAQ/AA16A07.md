title: "Describe the pharmacodynamic properties of propofol EXCLUDING its effects on the central nervous system. Describe how these influence clinical use."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2016
sitting: A
question: 7
passRate: 66
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question asked for the pharmacodynamics of propofol AND the clinical implications, excluding CNS effects. Presenting a complete list of these as well as the clinical consequences would be enough to pass. The majority did well with the CVS."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better candidates considered other systems in their answer, such as the metabolic effects e.g. propofol infusion syndrome, increased risk with mitochondrial abnormalities, and caloric loading with prolonged infusions."
- "Marks were awarded if there was mention of the constituents of propofol and how that relates to allergic reactions."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Despite this, a number of candidates still wasted time presenting pharmacokinetic information, describing its postulated mechanism of action in the CNS and its subsequent CNS effects. A few only listed pharmacodynamics with no clinical implications. Pharmaceutics were only accepted if it related to pharmacodynamic effects."
- "Almost all mentioned the negative consequences of a reduction in blood pressure but did not point out that it this can be advantageous for management of intraoperative hypertension."
- "Many did not mention bronchodilation, effects on upper airway tone, and the maintenance of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction."
- "When considering the genitourinary system, simply stating decreases renal blood flow, without any further qualification again scored no marks. Effects on uterine tone (compared to volatile) were rarely mentioned."
- "For example, many candidates merely listed allergy and this was not awarded any marks."
