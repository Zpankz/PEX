title: "Discuss the physical principles and equipment used for measurement of exhaled carbon dioxide by infrared analysis using sidestream sampling. Outline the potential sources of error."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2016
sitting: A
question: 1
passRate: 62
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected for a pass included a discussion of the principles of infrared analysis including details of molecular structure, the Beer-Lambert Law and how this pertains to the clinical circumstances in the question. A description of the equipment required for sidestream analysis was also required, and how each component works. Finally, sources of error were required in relation to the functioning of this equipment. In summary, this was an equipment question."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many answers contained headlines such as “blocked capnography tubing” or “collision-broadening” but did not go on to describe how that will influence the clinical interpretation of the capnography."
- "These discussions did not score marks."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most answers included a reasonable discussion of the principles of infrared analysis, and could describe most of the equipment. However, outlines of how the equipment might not function were less well handled."
- "This was an equipment question but many answers contained physiological discussions about the production and excretion of CO2 and how these affect the capnography trace."
