title: "Describe the physiological role of prostaglandins on smooth muscle throughout the body."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2016
sitting: A
question: 14
passRate: 35
EC_expectedDomains:
- "In this question, candidates were expected to define prostaglandins and to highlight the diversity of different derivatives produced. There are a number of smooth muscle groups that are of interest in this question. These include the vascular smooth muscle, pulmonary vasculature, bronchi, gastrointestinal tract and those in the genitourinary systems, especially the uterus and the urinary bladder. It should be noted that different prostaglandins may produce opposing effects. For instance, PGI2 is a vasodilator, but TxA2 contracts vascular smooth muscle. Similarly, the same prostaglandin may produce different effects in different tissues (e.g. PGI2 contracts sphincters in the gastrointestinal tract, but relaxes the vascular smooth muscle). Therefore, candidates should be specific in their answers by stating the prostaglandin and the muscle group involved."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates included irrelevant details, such as nociceptive effect, inflammatory function and gastric acid secretion as part of their answer. It was also noted that a substantial number of candidates did not attempt the question or wrote very minimally on the question, and may represent a problem of time management."
