title: "Describe the anatomy of the neonatal airway, and what implications this has for airway management."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2016
sitting: A
question: 3
passRate: 61
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Well structured answers were written as a table with two columns – listing the anatomical differences on the left, with each corresponding clinical implication on the right. Important points to cover included the large occiput/head, large tongue, epiglottis shape, and position of the larynx."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many answers morphed into a discussion of respiratory physiology (lung volumes, work of breathing, oxygen consumption etc.), however no marks were awarded for these points. Descriptions of anatomical differences needed to be specific. It is not enough to say ‘the airway is smaller’ or ‘the trachea is shorter’ as these points are self-evident."
- "The majority of candidates used the term “BURP” in relation to neonatal airway management. This stands for Backwards Upwards Rightwards Pressure, and is the most forceful version of external laryngeal manipulation (ELM). Performing this on a neonate would completely compress the airway, and distort the larynx. ELM for a neonate is done very gently, often with the laryngoscopist’s little finger. Medical terms like BURP should be used precisely."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Only three candidates correctly stated the ETT size and insertion length appropriate for a term neonate. The formula (age / 4) + 4 is only applicable after 1 year of age."
