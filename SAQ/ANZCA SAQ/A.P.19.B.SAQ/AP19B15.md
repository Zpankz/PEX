title: "Describe the anatomy and relations of the right internal jugular vein as relevant to performing central venous cannulation (23.6%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2019
sitting: B
question: 15
passRate: 23
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The major domains assessed in this question were the anatomy of the right internal jugular vein â€“ its origin, insertion, a description of the pathway the vein travels, the relations of the vein as it travels through the neck, the surface and sono-anatomy anatomy of the vein and their relevance to achieving safe, successful cannulation."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Credit was given for other relevant correct material."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The commonest error was to spend significant time describing central venous cannulation hence not answering the question asked. Other common problems were insufficient detail of the anatomical path and structures around the vein and inaccurate correlation of anatomy and technique. Diagrams unfortunately were commonly poorly drawn and attracted few additional marks, due to errors, no level specified for cross- sections and a lack of labels."
- "No marks were awarded for discussing clinical utility of CVC insertion. Complications of CVC insertion were also not assessed directly, but credit was given for describing these in light of anatomical relations or aspects of cannulation technique."
