title: "Draw the oxygen-haemoglobin and carbon dioxide-haemoglobin dissociation curves on the same axis (partial pressure vs. content). Compare and contrast these two curves."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2019
sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 28
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The domains assessed for this question were: Oxygen content of blood vs partial pressure graph, Description of this graph, Carbon dioxide content of blood vs partial pressure graph, Description of this graph"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Using haemoglobin saturation instead of gas content"
- "Omitting the venous oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve"
- "Confusing the arterio-venous difference in various CO2 carriage forms (carbamino, bicarbonate and dissolved)"
- "Not appreciating that the CO2 content of blood is greater than the O2 content of blood"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Although the question asked for it, candidates were not penalised if O2 and CO2 were not placed on the same graph. It is noted that there are two possible interpretations of the CO2 graph, and both were accepted."
resources:
- "The required information can be found in both Ganong and Nunn."
