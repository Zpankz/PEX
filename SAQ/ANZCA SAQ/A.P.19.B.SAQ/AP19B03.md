title: "Draw and label a lead II electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing for one cardiac cycle, indicating normal values. What is the PR interval and what factors influence it?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2019
sitting: B
question: 3
passRate: 50
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The major domains assessed in this question were (1) the ECG diagram (2) a description of the physiological basis for the PR interval and (3) a description (which included some explanation) of the factors influencing the PR interval."
- "It was expected that a range of ‘normal’ values would be quoted for each interval."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Correctly written descriptions of the intervals were given credit."
- "A good mark in this domain required some comment about the effect on AV conduction of several of these factors: the autonomic nervous system, electrolyte abnormalities, drugs, and pathology (fibrosis, accessory pathways, ischaemia)."
- "Credit was given for other relevant correct material."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common problems included – poorly drawn diagrams which lacked detail and contained errors. Diagrams should include axes and be large enough to include relevant features. For this question – half a page in the answer book would be an appropriate size."
- "Often the PR interval was drawn incorrectly (or not indicated) and other intervals were omitted or incorrect."
- "Many candidates spent valuable time ‘defining’ the ECG and including details about Einthoven’s triangle – which did not score marks – and meant they had less time to answer the question."
- "The physiological basis for the PR interval was often not discussed or incorrectly described (with many not mentioning the AV node anywhere in the answer)."
- "Similarly, factors influencing the PR interval were omitted, listed without discussion, or without explanation of effect on PR interval (i.e. increased or decreased). Errors and imprecise statements were common e.g. ‘electrolytes affect the PR interval’."
