question: 11
passRate: 73
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The domains assessed on this question were the effects of increased intra-abdominal pressure on the respiratory system, and the effects of increased intra-abdominal pressure on the cardiovascular system. The effects of CO2 absorption on both the respiratory and cardiovascular systems were also assessed."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Other relevant facts pertaining to pneumoperitoneum gained extra marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common failures included lack of addressing all domains, especially those relating to intra-abdominal pressure effects commonly seen in practice. Simple lists of effects with no explanation gained lower marks."
resources:
- "This topic is covered briefly in Perrin, M & Fletcher, A Continuing Education in Anaesthesia, Critical Care and Pain, Vol 4., No. 4, 200, as well as in more detail in Nunn’s applied respiratory physiology 8th ed. Ch. 20, or Miller’s Anaesthesia 7th ed. Ch. 21."
