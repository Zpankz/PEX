title: "Using ropivacaine and lignocaine as examples, explain the pharmacokinetic principles that affect speed of onset and duration of action of local anaesthetics."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2019
sitting: B
question: 9
passRate: 52
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The major domains assessed in this question were Onset: Diffusion principles and effect of pH and pKa on ionisation, Offset: The effect of physical properties and the effect of vasoconstriction and blood flow."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common problems were not answering both halves of the question or listing properties without indicating the effect of the property. It should be noted that additives affect lignocaine and ropivacaine differently. pKa is not the pH below which a drug is ionised, but rather the pH at which 50% of the drug is ionised."
