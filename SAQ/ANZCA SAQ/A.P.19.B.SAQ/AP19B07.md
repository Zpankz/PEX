title: "Describe how morbid obesity might affect washout after inhalation anaesthesia"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2019
sitting: B
question: 7
passRate: 63
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main domains assessed in this question were Definition of morbid obesity, Pharmacokinetics associated with morbid obesity, Effect of specific inhalational agent solubility on washout, Inhalational washout curve, Effect of anaesthetic duration, Respiratory problems of morbid obesity during recovery affecting washout"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Credit was given for other relevant correct material such as context sensitive recovey from inhalational anaesthesia, tissue equilibration times, decrement times of inhalational agents and the effect of controlled ventilation by the anaesthetist during emergence."
- "Better answers incorporated the effects of morbid obesity and specific inhalational agents into the washout curve."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common problems were Poor knowledge of respiratory changes of morbid obesity in the awake state and upon emergence of anaesthesia, Misconception about the effect of cardiac output on inhalational washout, Washout curves with wrongly labelled y-axis"
