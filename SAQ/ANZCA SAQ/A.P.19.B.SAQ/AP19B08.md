title: "Briefly explain the cardiovascular effects of central neuraxial blockade."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2019
sitting: B
question: 8
passRate: 62
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The major domains assessed in this question were: Definition of central neuraxial blockade, including understanding that spinal and epidural routes may have different effects, The role of the sympathetic nervous system as the cause of CVS changes, The primary CVS effects of neuraxial blockade at differing levels, The baroreceptor mediated reflex responses that occur as a result of these primary effects."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers were able to describe all of this and include mention of higher risk patients and reflexes such as the Bezold- Jarisch reflex, but very few recognized that blocking thoracolumbar sympathetic output will also block adrenal catecholamine release."
- "Credit was given for other correct relevant material."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common problems included: A misconception that neuraxial blockade only describes the spinal route, Confusion as to the relative importance of venodilation and arteriolar vasodilation, Poor descriptions of the baroreceptor mediated responses leading to tachycardia and vasoconstriction confined to levels above the block."
resources:
- "A concise description of all this can be found in Miller 8th Edition, Chapter 56."
