EC_extraCredit:
- "Other relevant detail also received credit."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common problems were: not addressing important parts of the question in sufficient detail, drawing graphs inaccurately (such as not having correctly labeled axes), and irrelevant descriptions of the pharmacology and mode of action of a wide range of non- inhalational agents. Inhalational anaesthetics include gaseous as well as volatile agents. Description of wash-in and wash-out was not relevant. Some candidates’ handwriting was a problem."
