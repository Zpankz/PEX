title: "Discuss the physiological responses to administration of 2 litres of Hartmann's solution intravenously over 1 hour to a conscious, healthy, euvolaemic 70kg adult."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2019
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 43
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Required statements that predominant distribution would be to extracellular fluid with correct amounts or proportion remaining intravascularly & then some moving intracellular due to hypoosmolar nature. Central integration with baroreceptor responses both high & low pressure & their significance was expected. The renal response including mention of ANP, ADH & RAAS required some explanation & details"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Even though not specifically asked, did make for a more complete answer & explanation"
- "Timing of fluid movements (half-life) added to a more complete explanation."
- "Predominant effects of increased venous return & increased pre- load with effects on blood pressure & venous capacitance allowed for a more comprehensive explanation of the cardiovascular consequences"
- "Extra credit was given for including content of the metabolic effects of the metabolism of lactate via the Cori cycle in the liver. Inclusion of the decrease in body temperature due to the potential for unwarmed volume of fluid also was rewarded"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "incorrect reading of the question as 1L over 2 hours & underestimation of the effects & responses."
- "Inclusion of generic facts about fluid distribution & ion movements not directly related to the specifics of the question did not attract marks."
- "Confusion over acid-base effects, osmolar & ionic changes"
- "No values given for composition of Hartmannâ€™s solution made it difficult for full explanation of fluid distribution & osmolar changes."
