title: "Compare and contrast the pharmacokinetics of orally and intravenously administered morphine and oxycodone."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2010
sitting: B
question: 1
passRate: 26
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Main Points expected for a Pass: Both Morphine & Oxycodone are full- agonist opioid analgesics used peri-operatively. They both can be administered orally or intravenously. They are roughly equipotent when administered intravenously but their oral bioavailability differs. Morphine has a high hepatic extraction, so Oxycodone is more potent when given orally. Major differences or similarities in basic pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters such as volume of distribution, clearance, protein binding, metabolism & half-life"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional Points which attracted higher marks: Actual numbers & content for PK parameters such as morphineâ€™s bioavailability being 30% compared to oxycodone which is 50-87%. Demonstrate an understanding of the role of pKa in ionization & lipid solubility in comparing the 2 drugs. Be able to calculate the dose adjustments & relative conversion between the 2 drugs based on their bioavailabilities. Be able to discuss accurately volume of distribution & plasma concentration. Discuss the different pathways of metabolism & clearance"
