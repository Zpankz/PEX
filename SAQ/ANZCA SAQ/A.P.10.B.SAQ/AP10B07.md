exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2010
sitting: B
question: 7
passRate: 67
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question was similar to that asked in a previous exam, and clearly some candidates used this to their advantage. The adverse effects portion of the question was generally well done, but insufficient to compensate for the absence of an answer for the first half of the question."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Generous margins were accepted for some of the numerical physical properties of oxygen, but marks could not be awarded for significant disparities. Although not specifically asked for on this occasion, marks were awarded for descriptions of how oxygen is manufactured where this was adequately linked to the relevant physical property."
