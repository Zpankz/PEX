title: "Describe the pharmacodynamic effects and clinical uses of anticholinesterase drugs."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2010
sitting: B
question: 5
passRate: 65
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A brief definition of an anti-cholinesterase and its effect on acetylcholine concentrations at cholinergic receptors was expected. Subsequently the marks were divided evenly between pharmacodynamics and clinical applications. Briefly an increase in acetylcholine levels at muscarinic receptors results in bradycardia, hypotension, salivation, bronchospasm, increased gut and urinary motility, miosis and central effects if the drug crosses the blood brain barrier."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Only a few candidates mentioned that muscarinic effects occurred at lower concentrations than nicotinic effects. Clinical uses of these agents are legion and were very well discussed. No value would be gained in repeating these here. Some candidates spent an inappropriate amount of time discussing organo-phosphates but by elaborating the adverse effects of these agents ('SLUDGE' acronym) they gained marks en passant for the pharmcodynamic effects"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "However the single largest error in answering this question was candidates discussed structure activity relationships and pharmacokinetics of individual agents at length and failed to mention any pharmacodynamics."
