- "A structured approach was expected and marks were distributed to the three main areas â€“ MOA, pharmacokinetics and adverse effects. Candidates were expected highlight the various mechanisms of action such that amiodarone can fit within most elements of the Vaughan Williams classification. A clear structure addressing the main areas relating to pharmacokinetics was helpful. It was expected candidates would appreciate the very long half life, high protein binding, significant tissue binding and large volume of distribution. Specific comments regarding the main toxicities were expected. In particular, the pulmonary toxicity (both acute and chronic variations) is important. In addition a variety of other issues should be mentioned, including thyroid changes and the well described skin and ocular changes."
EC_extraCredit:
