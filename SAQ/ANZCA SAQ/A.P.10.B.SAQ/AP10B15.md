title: "Explain the role of haemoglobin as a buffer."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2010
sitting: B
question: 15
passRate: 27
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Marks were awarded for a buffer definition, a brief description of haemoglobin structure, and listing the factors that create an effective buffer. Haemoglobin acts as an effective buffer for CO2 due to the solubility of CO2 , presence of carbonic anhydrase, and the capacity of haemoglobin. Important points that needed to be covered included; the importance of the large volume of haemoglobin, the role and amount of the imidazole side chains on the histidine residues, the effect that their pKa (6.8) has on buffering ability, and a clear description of the reactions within the red cell that involves CO2 conversion to HCO3- and H+ and the fate of these two products. Discussion about why the deoxy form of haemoglobin is a better buffer due to itâ€™s change in pKa (7.9), and that this occurs where buffering is needed most, which limits the pH drop for venous blood."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Some candidates correctly identified that the dissociation of carbamino compounds within the red cell adds H+ which then needs to be buffered."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Discussing the haemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve, carbon dioxide dissociation curve, and other buffers in the body did not attract marks."
