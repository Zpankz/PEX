EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates are reminded that where a question is asked in two parts, as with this one, it is best to answer it clearly in two parts. Most candidates were able to describe the composition of normal saline, although some added other molecules such as potassium and calcium to the mixture, and of albumin. Albumin also contains a reasonable about of sodium chloride, which was often neglected. Most answers correctly demonstrated an understanding of the distribution of normal saline between the intravascular and extra cellular compartments, and of the oncotic effects of albumin."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were gained by giving details about the mechanism of hyperchloraemic acidosis seen with infusion of large volumes of sodium chloride."
