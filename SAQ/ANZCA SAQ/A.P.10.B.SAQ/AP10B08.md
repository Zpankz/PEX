title: "Discuss the statistical methods which can be used for analysis of groups of categorical data."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2010
sitting: B
question: 8
passRate: 15
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Categorical data involves primarily nominal data but can include ordinal data (ranked groups). Inferential analysis could be divided into techniques for nominal data and ordinal data. Chi-squared analysis forms the backbone of analysis for nominal data. A discussion about how the test statistic is calculated and the underlying assumptions involved was expected."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Marks were awarded for providing brief examples. Descriptive statistics were often omitted, but could involve table of counts or graphical techniques such as bar graphs or pie charts. Extra marks were also awarded for the appropriate discussion of Fisherâ€™s Exact Test and Yates correction. Ratio analysis was rarely discussed, but extra marks were awarded for discussion about relative risk and odds ratio. A discussion about non-parametric analysis in relation to some types of ordinal data (eg. Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and pain scores) was awarded extra marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates failed to provide a clear definition. A frequent mistake was to discuss parametric analysis for categorical data (eg. Student T test, ANOVA). Categorical data do not generally meet the assumptions required for parametric analysis."
