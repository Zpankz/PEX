EC_expectedDomains:
- "The principal muscles of ventilation are the diaphagm and the intercostals (internal, external). Other important muscles are the abdominals and the accessory muscles of the neck which are recruited in times of need. A precise description of the mechanical effects of these muscles was expected i.e. how these muscles increase or decrease the intrathoracic volume. Desciption of the anatomy of the diaphragm and the chest wall was also helpful. Mention of the pharyngeal and laryngeal muscles and their role in ventilation was also expected."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were available for the following: effects of posture; special patient groups, including pregnancy and neonates; co-ordination in the medullary respiratory centre; non-ventilatory actions of these muscles (cough, vomiting and defaecation); muscle subtypes; smooth muscle."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates who failed did so because they did not name and describe the actions of most of these muscles or did so but only in vague terms."
