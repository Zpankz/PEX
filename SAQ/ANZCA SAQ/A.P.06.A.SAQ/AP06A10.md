title: "List the physiological factors which increase respiratory rate and include a brief explanation of the mechanism by which each achieves this increase."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2006
sitting: A
question: 10
passRate: 62
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Points required for a pass were: Listing and understanding of the mechanisms by which hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis induce hyperpnoea plus some of the other common causes of tachypnoea (e.g. exercise, increased BMR, hypotension, activation of skeletal muscle stretch, various pulmonary conditions/receptors/work of breathing, CNS causes - voluntary control and in response to pain, age, pregnancy.."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were given for: Quantitative description of various stimuli, synergistic interactions."
- "Whilst some marks were awarded for description of the various brain-stem centres that control breathing, the descriptions were often not directly linked to tachypnoea."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some candidates wasted time describing factors that slowed respiratory rate, and the definitions of alveolar ventilation."
