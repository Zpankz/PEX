sitting: A
question: 08
passRate: 46
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to provide a definition of what “Statistical Power” is in the context of a clinical trial and to show a good understanding of the concept."
- "Although mathematical equations for sample size calculation were not required, an understanding of the different factors and their significance were expected."
- "Candidates needed to discuss alpha and beta error, measurement effect and measurement variability."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates who mentioned why meta-analysis increases statistical power, the issues with multiple outcomes, interim analysis and drop out gained more marks."
- "Very few candidates mentioned that different formulas and nomograms are often used and currently computer programs make sample size calculations more precise."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many demonstrated inadequate understanding of the relationship between sample size and power."
- "Many candidates mentioned the main factors affecting sample size but most failed to give the desired values commonly used for alpha and beta error or how population variability is estimated."
