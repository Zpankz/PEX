title: "Classify and describe the main cellular and molecular mechanisms by which chemical neurotransmitters exert their effects. Use examples from cholinergic and adrenergic neurotransmission to illustrate the answer."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2006
sitting: A
question: 12
passRate: 42
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was important that candidates read the question."
- "The question was based around cellular and molecular mechanisms, with candidates asked to classify and describe them."
- "Importantly examples from the cholinergic vs. adrenergic systems were expected"
- "In general terms, neuro transmitters can exert their affects on ion channels in cell membranes or through intracellular affects."
- "Ion channels can be affected by receptor agonists or antagonists, directly or indirectly (through, for example, G proteins)."
- "Intracellular events are usually mediated via G proteins and second messenger systems."
- "Most candidates addressed the issue of agonists and antagonists at cell membrane receptors affecting ion channels well, most usually citing the neuromuscular junction as an example."
- "Most candidates dealt well with the G protein mediated second messenger system, and cited a number of examples."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Areas such as the relative response times of G protein verses direct ion channel effects, modulation and/or amplification, and other complex affects such as MRNA transcription or other neuro modulators were rarely mentioned."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "It was notable that many candidates chose examples from different systems."
- "The effects of G proteins on ion channels were very rarely mentioned. This is relevant for example, M1 muscarinic receptors."
