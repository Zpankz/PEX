title: "Briefly describe the measurement of pH in a blood sample using a pH electrode."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2006
sitting: A
question: 15
passRate: 49
EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a pass, the answer needed to include a description of the apparatus used, including the presence of pH sensitive glass, two reference electrodes Ag/AgCl and the same, or calomel (Hg/HgCl2) although more modern machines do not use the calomel electrode, a salt bridge to complete the circuit, connecting the calomel or 2nd Ag/AgCl electrode to the test solution, a buffer solution separated from the sample by pH sensitive glass."
- "The only variable in the circuit, given constant temperature, is the difference in pH between the buffer and sample."
- "The electrode potential depends on the Hydrogen ion activity, so the voltage measured in the circuit is proportional to pH."
- "There is a need to calibrate against two known pH Phosphate solutions, and the system must be temperature controlled to 37C."
- "The device is an example of an ion-sensitive electrode."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A clearly-labelled diagram was a great help, and although not required for a pass, most of the better answers did include one."
- "Better answers included detail about how the glass is pH-sensitive, why saturated KCl is used as the salt bridge, a correct definition of pH, and additional information about minimization of error."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some answers unfortunately had a diagram at odds with the text, making it very difficult to assess understanding."
- "Answers which described the Clarke or Severinghaus electrodes gained no marks."
- "Many answers included a reasonable diagram but text that inferred a very poor understanding of what was drawn."
- "The concept of an electrical circuit was absent in most answers that failed."
- "Several dozen answers defined pH incorrectly, as a variable in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation."
- "Lengthy discussion of CO2 control in hypothermia gained little and usually left minimal information that actually answered the question."
- "No candidate mentioned solid-state ion-sensitive field-effect transistors which have been used in pH measurement for 10 or more years."
