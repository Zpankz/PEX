title: "Describe the pharmacodynamic properties of propofol and how this influences its clinical usage."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2006
sitting: A
question: 04
passRate: 69
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected emphasis be placed on the central nervous system effects, followed by the cardiovascular and respiratory effects and marks were allocated accordingly."
- "The question was specifically related to pharmacodynamics and a discussion of pharmacokinetic properties scored no additional marks."
- "Candidates were expected to outline that Propofol is an intravenous anaesthetic agent used for both the induction and maintenance of anaesthesia or sedation."
- "A description of the cardiovascular effects was expected to include reference to hypotension, reduced systemic vascular resistance and bradycardia with comment on those patients at risk."
- "Respiratory effects include alterations in ventilatory response, reduction in airway reflexes and bronchial tone."
- "It was expected that candidates would relate each pharmacodynamic effect to the impact on clinical use and failing to address this was a common omission (e.g. reduction of airway reflexes is useful for LMA insertion or airway manipulation)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Reward was given to candidates who outlined potential mechanisms of action, the dose dependent nature of effects, the effects on the EEG and on cerebral metabolism."
- "Further credit was given for describing how this might impact on its clinical use (e.g. neurosurgery)."
- "Extra credit was given for discussion of other pharmacodynamic properties including; anti-emetic, anti-pruritic, non MH triggering, pain on injection, lipid/caloric load, reduction in intraocular pressure and risk of propofol infusion syndrome."
- "Well organised answers such as those with an ordered list with subheadings or a table were rewarded."
