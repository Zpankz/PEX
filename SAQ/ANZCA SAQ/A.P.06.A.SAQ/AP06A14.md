title: "Explain the physiological processes which cause oliguria in response to hypovolaemic shock."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2006
sitting: A
question: 14
passRate: 38
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The following points and concepts should have been included: A simple brief definition of hypovolaemic shock and oliguria, The result is to reduce sodium loss and increase water retention, How renal blood flow is reduced and why this is beneficial, Mechanisms for the reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and the relationship of GFR to renal artery pressure, Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system starting with prorenin and listing the roles of angiotensin II, Effects of aldosterone and anti-diuretic hormone"
- "This question required a well organised answer so that the major points could be covered in enough detail."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Lack of detail around mechanisms of action was common and many candidates did not mention autoregulation of renal blood flow or the relationship of renal artery pressure and GFR."
- "Afferent and efferent glomerular arteriolar effects of angiotensin II and noradrenaline were often confused."
- "A lengthy description of systemic blood pressure control, the factors comprising Starlingâ€™s equation, and the counter-current mechanism was not expected."
- "Details on atrial naturetic peptide were not relevant to the mechanisms of oliguria."
