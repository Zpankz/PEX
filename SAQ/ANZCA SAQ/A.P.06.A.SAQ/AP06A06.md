title: "Explain the possible mechanisms for prolonged neuromuscular blockade after a four hour procedure using a non-depolarising muscle relaxant."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2006
sitting: A
question: 06
passRate: 34
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main mechanisms expected to be addressed were: Overdose, Pharmacokinetic; hypothermia, hepatic failure, renal failure, Pharmacodynamic drug interactions (e.g. volatiles, antibiotics), physiological disturbance (hypothermia, acidosis, electrolyte abnormalities), neuromuscular abnormality ( e.g. myaesthenia gravis)"
- "Candidates were asked to \"Explain...\" the mechanisms by which the various mechanisms produced prolonged neuromuscular blockade."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Few answers considered the potential for a combined effect created by the clinical context of the question."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The majority of candidates listed some mechanisms that could prolong neuromuscular block but frequently omitted an adequate explanation."
