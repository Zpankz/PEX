title: "Discuss the production and function of red blood cells"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2009
sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 48
EC_expectedDomains:
- "RBCS are derived from a common precursor in the bone marrow and liver in adults This precursor is a pleuripotential cell ie can differentiate into all blood cell lines."
- "It differentiates into various cell lines, including the Colony-Forming-Unit Erythrocyte (CFU-E), which is stimulated by various colony stimulating factors to differentiate into smaller and smaller cells."
- "Haemoglobin concentration increases as differentation continues."
- "The function of the RBC is related to its content of haemoglobin."
- "RBCs transport oxygen and carbon dioxide, and have a major role in the buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid."
- "Candidates were expected to briefly outline how the cells carries out these functions."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Marks were obtained for correctly detailing actions and production of erythropoietin; the structure of haemoglobin, and other structural factors unique to RBCs (eg lack of nucleus and mitochondria)."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates who did not address both parts of the question were unlikely to pass, as approximately half the marks were awarded for each part of the question."
- "Common errors included mention of: \"half life of RBCs as 120 days\" - rather than average life span; \"myeloid stem cells\" rather than erythroid; Giving numerical ranges for Hb levels - but listing it as the RBC count; reticulocytes having a nucleus - they do not"
