title: "Describe the role of insulin in fat metabolism"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2009
sitting: B
question: 11
passRate: 36
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The following were the main points expected for a pass: • description of insulin and its actions as an anabolic hormone, and consequences of activation of insulin receptors, - the effects of insulin on liver: increased uptake glucose; production of glycerol and free fatty acids; and decreased ketogenesis, - the effects of insulin on adipose tissue: glucose uptake; synthesis of fatty acids and glycerol and - the activation of lipoprotein lipase and inhibition of hormone sensitive lipase."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Bonus marks were given for: • a structured approach to insulin’s action in fat metabolism, -key enzymes involved in liver and adipose tissue, - lipoprotein transport in blood and breakdown and uptake by adipose tissue."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common mistakes included: • only focusing on one of the following: fat uptake from gut, fat synthesis in liver or adipose tissue, or the role of increased glucose uptake; - confusing anabolic and catabolic actions, - providing information about actions of other hormones, - providing information about diabetes and carbohydrate metabolism while neglecting to cover fat metabolism."
