EC_expectedDomains:
- "Expected was a brief description of the clinical uses and the most common formulation of propofol."
- "At this point candidates who performed well divided their answer to adverse effects due to propofol and those secondary to the formulation."
- "Common cardio-respiratory effects of propofol were well described."
- "That propofol resulted in sedation and anaesthesia was almost universally recognised but few commented on the narrow therapeutic window between the two."
- "Again, most candidates identified excitatory movements with induction but fewer correctly described the mechanism or explained the contradictory EEG effects and the use of propofol for status epilepticus."
- "Common side effects related to the formulation including pain, bacterial contamination, use of preservatives were well discussed."
- "Metabolic effects from prolonged infusion including lipaemia, propofol infusion syndrome and the propensity to produce green coloured hair and urine was discussed by the majority."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Few however mentioned alternative solvents including liposomes, medium chain triglycerides and cyclodextrins."
- "That subclinical doses of propofol produce euphoria and explain the abuse potential unique to this drug also received a mark."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common mistakes were to discuss the pharmacokinetics of propofol, adverse effects related to the formulation only and beneficial central nervous system effects."
