title: "Explain the physiological processes that cause oliguria in response to hypovolaemic shock"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2009
sitting: B
question: 13
passRate: 64
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points would be: a brief definition of oliguria and of hypovolaemic shock followed by an appreciation that oliguria occurs secondary to two main effects, namely a decreased RBF and GFR and an associated increased sodium and water retention."
- "Subsequent explanation as to why the RBF and GFR drop and the neuro-endocrine responses occasioning the sodium and water retention would result in a good pass."
- "The answer would include a brief discussion of the systemic influences on RBF and GFR as well as a description of the role of the sympathetic system, the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system and of ADH on salt and water homeostasis."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were rewarded for a mention of renal autoregulation, differential afferent and efferent arteriolar effects, effects of ACTH and ANF and the effects of age."
- "Better answers demonstrated a structured and methodical approach to answering the question with minimal repetition."
- "Some of these answers were in narrative form, others in a graphical format."
- "Correct information, appropriately structured was rewarded regardless of the format chosen to answer the question."
- "Only two candidates mentioned the possibility that this situation could progress to acute renal failure."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This is the fourth time that this question has been asked."
- "A frequent error was to state that afferent constriction was greater than efferent."
- "Many answers gave incorrect values for the range in which renal autoregulation is seen, believing it occurs down to a MAP of 50 mmHg."
- "The main reasons for candidates not passing this question were either poor organisation, repetition of information or just not enough substance in their answer."
