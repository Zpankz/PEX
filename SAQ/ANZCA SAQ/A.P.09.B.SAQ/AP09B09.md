title: "Classify the causes of hypotension in the early post-operative period, giving relevant examples."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2009
sitting: B
question: 09
passRate: 37
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The minimum requirement to pass this question was to discuss the causes of hypotension and to provide at least one example relevant to the postoperative period."
- "Most successful candidates classified the causes of hypotension by physiological mechanism (reduction in systemic vascular resistance or cardiac output)."
- "This provided a logical framework to discuss the relevant causes of reduced preload, contractility, heart rate and systemic vascular resistance."
- "Provided that these areas were covered adequately, those candidates who provided a clinical classification of the causes of postoperative hypotension were also successful."
EC_extraCredit:
- ""
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Few candidates correctly defined hypotension as a 20% fall in the patientâ€™s mean or systolic blood pressure or commented on its significance."
- "Detailed descriptions of differing clinical situations producing hypotension by the same mechanism (eg. causes of hypovolaemia) did not attract extra marks."
