entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2009
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 36
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This is a wide ranging question concerning many aspects of respiratory physiology:- physiologically relevant anatomy; ventilation and gas exchange; lung volumes; mechanics of breathing; pulmonary circulation; control of breathing; and haemoglobin."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Differences and similarities are both absolute (neonates are small) and relative (values indexed to weight or FRC)."
- "Mention of clinical implications gained extra marks."
- "Well organised answers were frequently in a table form."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The neonatal period is from 0-28 days and this question predominantly concerned term neonates."
- "This is not a question about the transition from intra- to extrauterine life nor is it a question about the pathophysiology of prematurity."
- "The low pass rate resulted from most candidates not producing enough relevant detail in each of these areas."
