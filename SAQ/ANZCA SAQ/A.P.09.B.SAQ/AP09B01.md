title: "Sevoflurane and fentanyl are a common anaesthetic drug combination. Discuss pharmacological reasons why it is useful to use them together."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2009
sitting: B
question: 01
passRate: 30
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question required candidates to detail the beneficial uses and effects of combining sevoflurane and fentanyl."
- "Most answers began with a brief description of each drug and its usual indications of use."
- "The synergistic drug interaction was the primary focus expected."
- "This included discussions about reductions in MAC, MAC-BAR, MAC-awake."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for specifying percentage reductions or proportionally greater reductions in MAC-BAR versus MAC-awake."
- "Successful candidates were able to detail the beneficial consequences of this synergistic interaction, which primarily revolved around reduced drug doses of each resulting in reduced adverse effects."
- "This included discussions about enhanced cardiovascular stability with airway instrumentation or surgical stimulation, reductions in sevoflurane adverse effects (hypotension, increased CBF/ICP, reduced uterine tone), and reductions in fentanyl side effects (prolonged sedation or respiratory depression, opioid induced nausea and vomiting)."
- "Bonus marks were awarded for discussion about the possibility of using fentanyl as a sole anaesthetic and the benefit of adding a volatile to an opioid based anaesthetic."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some candidates were confused about the whether sevoflurane provided analgesia."
- "Whilst sevoflurane in high enough doses can ablate responses to surgery via its global CNS depressant effect, it does not have a specific analgesic action."
