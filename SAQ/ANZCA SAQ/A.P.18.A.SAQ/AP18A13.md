EC_expectedDomains:
- "To score well on this question both halves had to be addressed."
- "Candidates who did well generally began with an accurate definition of compliance, usual units and values, and then went on to elaborate upon lung compliance including its determinants."
- "In the second half of the question attention had to turn to static and dynamic compliance."
- "Descriptions of these and how each were measured led neatly into a discussion of some of the important causes of time dependence."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Accurately drawn diagrams often aided the descriptions being given, but were not a requirement to do well."
