title: "Describe the washout of sevoflurane from a patient following two hours of general anaesthesia. You may wish to use a graph to illustrate the description."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2018
sitting: A
question: 6
passRate: 54
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To achieve a pass in this question the following were required : A clear explanation of the elimination kinetics of Sevoflurane with due consideration to a time course appropriate to the termination of anaesthesia after two hours."
- "A washout graph including appropriate axis labelling, a multi exponential decay curve, time course and half times consistent with volatile washout."
- "A description of the movement of Sevoflurane out of the alveolus, from plasma to alveolus, from the various compartments to plasma and their respective time courses and a description of factors which underpin those kinetics; including depth and duration of anaesthesia, alveolar ventilation and fresh gas flows, compartmental blood flows and solubilities."
EC_extraCredit:
- "It was very difficult to pass the question without a washout graph."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Confused graphs with no or inappropriate time courses indicated, nonsensical axis labelling or graphing of wash-in and wash-out on the same graph."
- "Detailed descriptions of Fickâ€™s law which wasted time and did not score points."
- "An overemphasis on the role of cardiac output in washout and incorrect assertions that increased cardiac output speeds washout."
- "Conflation of washout and awakening from anaesthetic as the same thing."
- "The incorrect assertion that following two hours the fat is completely saturated with Sevoflurane."
- "The confusion of partial pressures, concentrations and amounts."
- "Wash-in graphs did not score points."
