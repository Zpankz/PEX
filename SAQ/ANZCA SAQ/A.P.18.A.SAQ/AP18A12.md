sitting: A
question: 12
passRate: 73
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good answers included the hydrophilic outer substitution and hydrophobic inner substitution of sugammadex, an excellent answer would have included that gamma cyclodextrin has eight sugar moieties, carboxyl outer substitution or hydroxyl inner substitution."
- "Better answers also included pseudo-obstruction, atonic bladder and myasthenia gravis."
- "Better answers mentioned a ceiling effect at 70 microgram per kg."
- "Better answers included a description of how neostigmine interacts with acetylcholinesterase to inhibit it."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This question was generally answered well."
- "Many candidates included pharmaceutics."
- "However there was inconsistency regarding light stability of sugammadex (manufacturer recommends use within 5 days if not protected from light)."
- "Some candidates demonstrated a lack of understanding of basic chemistry, with confusion between amides and amines, tertiary and quaternary groups and the consequences of covalent bonds."
- "Indications for the use of neostigmine were often limited to reversal of neuromuscular blockade."
- "Glaucoma was seldom mentioned."
- "Two candidates mentioned the intrathecal use for analgesia."
- "Although bioavailability is poor, oral preparations are available, with dosing in the order of 30mg."
- "Neostigmine dosing was highly variable (0.5 microgram per kg â€“ 50 mg per kg)."
- "Metabolism was frequently believed to be hepatic, rather than hydrolysis by plasma esterases."
- "Frequently, side effects of neostigmine were categorised as cholinergic, with no differentiation between muscarinic or nicotinic effects."
