EC_expectedDomains:
- "To gain good marks candidates were required to demonstrate an understanding of the mechanism of actions of platelets in both primary and secondary haemostasis."
- "This includes the triggers and actions in the steps of adhesion, activation, amplification and aggregation not just the words."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The integration with initiation, amplification and propagation of the clotting cascade by platelet activation gained marks."
- "Knowledge of the actions of factors released from the platelet granules, eg thromboxane A2 causing local vasoconstriction as well as facilitating aggregation and platelet derived growth factor enhancing vessel healing was required for a good mark, rather than just a list."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The clotting cascade itself was not required for this question."
