title: "Separate booklet on upper airway anatomy (not published)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2018
sitting: A
question: 1
passRate: 67
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The anatomy of the oral cavity and oropharynx has direct relevance to airway assessment, and correct application of the Malampatti score."
- "This is essential anatomical knowledge for safe insertion of a nasal tube (inferomedial to the inferior turbinate), or for nasal insertion of a fibreoptic scope (in terms of understanding what you are looking at)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Credit was given on the exam for also mentioning the corniculates, although these are tiny cartilages located at the apex of each arytenoid."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Although 67% of candidates passed this question, there were very few high scores."
- "The majority could not name the palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal arches (alternative terminology was accepted)."
- "Most candidates drew three turbinates, but about half drew them as originating from the nasal septum, and many drawings did not reflect an understanding of the true size of the turbinates."
- "Very few candidates could explain how this happens â€“ for humidification in particular."
- "Few candidates mentioned the critical link between warming and humidification."
- "No candidate stated correct values which are achieved in the nose, and why the nose needs to be cooler than core temperature."
- "Most candidates struggled with their understanding of the arytenoid, corniculate, and cuneiform cartilages."
- "Stylised line drawings which are found in some textbooks (as distinct from the live anatomy which we look at daily) can be misleading."
- "In reality, the corniculate and cuneiform cartilages are very small."
- "Posteriorly, there is a midline groove at the point where the left and right aryepiglottic folds meet."
- "This vital anatomical landmark is called the posterior commissure."
- "With a difficult laryngoscopy, this may be the only visible laryngeal structure."
