title: "Outline the theories, both current and discredited, as to how volatile anaesthetic agents cause loss of consciousness."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2018
sitting: A
question: 3
passRate: 31
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was not possible to pass, however, by only answering one part of the question."
- "An understanding that the mechanism is unclear gained marks."
- "The Meyer-Overton hypothesis relates to the linear relationship between the log of potency and lipid solubility and many tried to draw a graph illustrating this."
- "Modern theories suggest that agents may be acting on hydrophobic areas of proteins, particularly the GABA receptor."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Other ways of attracting marks were to discuss why people thought that lipid solubility might be related to potency, and why these theories were discarded."
- "Mentioning other receptors that may be involved, most notably the NMDA receptor, and noting this is predominantly affected by gaseous rather than volatile agents."
- "Noting the volatile agents are relatively indiscriminate, and cause effects on many different types of proteins."
- "Mentioning some anatomical potential sites of action."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This is a key part of our practice."
- "It seems reasonable that a candidate for a specialist examination should know something about the topic."
- "Many candidates wrote about wash-in, which was not asked."
- "Many stated that the Meyer Overton hypothesis is currently held to be valid."
