title: "List the desired and adverse effects of opioids and the corresponding anatomical location of the receptors being activated."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2018
sitting: A
question: 5
passRate: 29
EC_expectedDomains:
- "In order to achieve a satisfactory mark, candidates need to identify a range of desired and/or adverse effects of opioids and make some attempt at the location of the opioid receptors being activated to produce these effects."
- "Analgesia needed be mentioned, including supraspinal and spinal location of opioid receptors."
- "An understanding that effects such as sedation, dysphoria, euphoria, tolerance and addiction involve activation of widespread opioid receptors within the brain, should be appreciated."
- "Also, there should be an understanding that not all opioid effects are centrally mediated."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better candidates mentioned cardiovascular effects of opioids, miosis, skeletal muscle rigidity, immunosuppressive and hormonal effects of opioids and described the mechanism by which these effects occur."
- "Candidates who followed a systems approach did better."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common errors included: not listing effects (as stated in the question) or listing opioid receptor subtypes and describing their location without correlating receptor location to effect."
