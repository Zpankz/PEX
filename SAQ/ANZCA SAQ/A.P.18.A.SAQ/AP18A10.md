title: "Describe the determinants of left ventricular myocardial oxygen supply and demand."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2018
sitting: A
question: 10
passRate: 58
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Most candidates were able to apply the hydraulic analogue of Ohms law to define coronary blood flow as coronary perfusion pressure over coronary vascular resistance."
- "Information about oxygen demand needed to include a discussion of the role of heart rate (and its effects on supply and demand), myocardial contractility, preload and afterload."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers correctly explained the factors involved in oxygen supply including normal resting left coronary blood flow, oxygen content of blood, oxygen extraction ratio of left ventricle and its implications, phasic blood flow in the LV myocardium (including an adequate explanation why), coronary vascular resistance and autoregulation (listing all of the factors affecting this)."
- "Better candidates were able to correctly apply LaPlace’s law to the left ventricle to discuss the relationship of wall tension to LV afterload and oxygen demand."
- "Only a few candidates discussed the concept of cardiac work and applied that to myocardial oxygen consumption."
- "Extra marks were given for discussing the relative importance of ‘pressure work’ vs ‘volume work’."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Incorrect graphs of coronary blood flow vs time."
- "Neglecting to discuss the oxygen content of blood."
- "Incorrectly defining and applying the Law of LaPlace and confusing the terms tension/pressure/afterload."
- "Many candidates provided reasonable information about oxygen supply but then had poor descriptions of the factors affecting oxygen demand with few explaining why increasing heart rate, contractility or afterload caused an increase in oxygen consumption."
