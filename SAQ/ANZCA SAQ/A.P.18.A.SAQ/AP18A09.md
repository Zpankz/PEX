title: "Discuss the determinants of renal blood flow."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2018
sitting: A
question: 9
passRate: 32
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Main points expected included an appreciation that renal flow exceeds metabolic demands for the purpose of high glomerular filtration to regulate body fluid volumes and solute concentrations."
- "Also, marks were gained for demonstrating understanding that renal blood flow follows haemodynamic principles and how this is affected by autoregulation (both myogenic and tubuloglomerular feedback)."
- "Integral to this is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system of which some detail was expected."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better candidates correctly described the effect of angiotensin II on renal arteriolar tone, renal blood flow and GFR."
- "This group also appropriately mentioned the role of the sympathetic nervous system and other mediators."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Simply listing the anatomical flow path did not attract credit unless accompanied by an explanation of how the anatomy affects resistance e.g. many parallel pathways reduce vascular resistance."
- "Tubuloglomerular feedback was frequently not well described."
- "A common mistake was to link a given change in NaCl concentration to the incorrect change in arteriolar tone and subsequently blood flow; the effect on GFR was frequently neglected."
