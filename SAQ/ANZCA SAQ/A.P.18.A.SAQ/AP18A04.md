title: "Outline the hazards associated with the use of CO2 absorbents within a circle breathing system and how the risks can be minimised."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2018
sitting: A
question: 4
passRate: 39
EC_expectedDomains:
- "In order to pass this question candidates needed to discuss several of the risks associated with the use of CO2 absorbers AND the ways in which these risks could be minimised."
- "There are multiple risks due to the presence of CO2 absorbent in the circuit, regardless of the nature of the absorbent and also some risks which are absorbent specific."
- "To pass the candidates must have demonstrated an understanding of these differences, and discussed general risks and at least one agent specific risk."
- "The discussion of risk reduction needed to be internally consistent, demonstrating that the candidate understood the rationale for the risk reduction method."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better candidates were able to differentiate agent specific risks, either by comparing soda lime to older, more hazardous absorbents, such as Baralyme, or newer agents free from agent- specific risks, such as Amsorb, a Ca(OH)2-based absorbent."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A carbon dioxide absorber is an integral part of the circle breathing circuit."
- "Common errors, apart from errors of omission (which were the most common errors by far), were: including irrelevant detail, which did not score marks, including the chemical equations associated with CO2 absorbers or the constituents of the different absorbents (unless this related directly to a discussion of risk); incorrectly describing the effects of gas flow and moisture."
