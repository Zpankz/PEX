title: "Justify the dose of propofol you would expect to use to induce anaesthesia in the following scenarios, using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles. (a) 4 year old child weighing 15kg (25%) (b) 75 year old man weighing 70kg (25%) (c) 40 year old man weighing 70kg with severe hypovolaemic shock (50%)"

question: 7
passRate: 63
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To pass this question required documenting appropriate dosing regimens and justifying them using pharmacological principles."
- "The induction dose of propofol is primarily dependent on the volume of the intravascular compartment, cardiac output and the brain sensitivity to the drug."
- "Most candidates described appropriate doses and explained the altered volumes of distribution in each scenario."
- "Pharmacodynamic concerns particularly with regards to adverse cardiovascular effects were generally well noted."
- "Pleasingly most candidates noted that propofol should be used with great caution in the shocked patient and a markedly reduced dose is indicated."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers addressed scenario (c) well and noted that the shocked patient has a markedly reduced intravascular compartment volume and cardiac output with preservation of normal CBF - consequently a larger proportion of their contracted blood volume is directed to a brain which has increased sensitivity to anaesthetic agents."
- "Again, better candidates described how they would ameliorate the adverse pharmacodynamic effects of propofol in this scenario."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates provided a generic list of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data for propofol which did not attract marks."
- "A common misconception made was that alterations in clearance and metabolism affect induction doses."
- "They do not."
- "Many candidates asserted that an elderly patient would have a significantly reduced cardiac output."
- "This is not the case in an elderly patient without co-morbidities."
- "Several candidates erroneously suggested that cardiac output in a patient with severe hypovolaemic shock would be increased."
- "The effect of cardiac output on the apparent volume of distribution was poorly understood with most discussions being exclusively devoted to the effect on the duration of onset of action."
