title: "Discuss the potential adverse effects of NON depolarising muscle relaxants."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2015
sitting: B
question: 7
passRate: 1
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This is a pharmacology question."
- "The most effective way of presenting adverse effects of non-depolarising muscle relaxants was by class of drug."
- "For benzylisoquinolones discussion was expected to include details pertaining to histamine release: a brief description of drug structure including stereoisomerism to explain drug differences within this class, quantification of the effect, briefly clinical consequences and ways to mitigate."
- "For aminosteroids discussion of anaphylaxis and vagolytic/autonomic effects was expected."
- "Again structure activity explanations attracted additional marks."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for appropriate mention of laudanosine."
- "Consequences of prolonged administration and concurrent disease with respect to drug pharmacokinetics could be included as a separate section or within those for drug classes."
- "Reference to drugs no longer in use was appropriate in the context of receptor affinity."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common mistakes included vague statements, repetition of information and incorrect information especially with respect to autonomic receptors."
- "No marks were awarded for mechanisms of action of non depolarising muscle relaxants at the neuromuscular junction, treatment of anaphylaxis, drug interactions causing prolonged block or side-effects of reversal agents."
- "Nor was there credit for describing clinical consequences of failure to provide safe relaxant general anaesthesia."
