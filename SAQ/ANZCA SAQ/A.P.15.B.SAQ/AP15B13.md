exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2015
sitting: B
question: 13
passRate: 29
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The answer required a brief description of the paramagnetic properties of oxygen, and the modern type of paramagnetic oxygen analysers using an oscillating electromagnet."
- "The fuel cell required an accurate description of the relevant electrochemistry."
EC_extraCredit:
- "High marks were awarded for those answers that included a diagram or detailed description."
- "Discussions on response times, sampling, calibration, exhaustion, power sources and role in breath to breath analysis also received marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "It appeared that this was a subject that many candidates had omitted to study at all; but of those that had most were able to score well."
- "It should be noted that the old glass spheres type of anaylser is too slow for use in anaesthesia, and the frequent discussions on this apparatus received little if any marks."
- "A fuel cell is not synonymous with a Clark electrode, but many candidates seemed to think it is."
