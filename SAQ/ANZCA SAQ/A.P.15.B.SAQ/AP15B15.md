EC_expectedDomains:
- "A discussion of operating room electrical supply design features, followed by electrical device design features was expected."
- "The rationale behind these designs and their limitations was also expected."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Several candidates failed badly."
- "Most candidates attempted to open with a definition of macroshock and microshock, frequently quoting the typical currents required to induce ventricular fibrillation."
- "Most candidates had only a superficial understanding of electrical shock prevention."
- "Several candidates could (correctly) list some safety features, but contributed little more."
- "A discussion of diathermy and burns related phenomena was not required."
- "Only a handful of candidates knew that diathermy produced an alternating current at a frequency several orders of magnitude greater than that of mains supply, or why the frequency of the current was important."
