title: "Discuss the concepts of half life and context sensitive half-time with examples from anaesthetic pharmacology."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2015
sitting: B
question: 4
passRate: 58
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A pass mark in this question could be achieved by giving an accurate definition of both half life and context sensitive half time followed by some discussion of the concepts."
- "When discussing context sensitive half time (CSHT), it was expected that the candidates would discuss a multi-compartmental model to help explain CSHT."
EC_extraCredit:
- "With respect to half life, marks were gained for discussing it as an exponential process which is related directly to volume of distribution and inversely to clearance (t1./2 = 0.693 Vd/CL) and that it is best used when describing a single compartmental model."
- "Those who talked about half life in a multi-compartmental model, gained points for accurately describing both distribution and elimination half lives, each with its own exponential curve."
- "Discussion of the clinical utility of half life, in determining: time to steady state with intermittent dosing and; dosing interval, was also awarded points."
- "Marks were given for discussing how the features of a drugâ€™s pharmacokinetic profile e.g. volume of distribution, lipid solubility & clearance, would affect context sensitive half time."
- "A well drawn graph used to support the discussion was often useful, but merely reproducing a graph with no explanation scored minimal points."
- "Extra marks were given to those candidates who used CSHT to discuss which drugs are appropriate, or not, for infusions (both short and long) and how they are used in TCI modeling."
- "Stating that both half life and CSHT did not necessarily correlate with the drugs duration of effect was rewarded."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Listing the half lives of drugs attracted no marks unless it was framed in a clinical context (e.g short distribution half life of propofol determines offset of effect after a bolus, rather than the longer elimination half life)."
- "Common sources of error were poor definitions, especially for CSHT."
- "A number of candidates provided no discussion of half life."
- "There was significant confusion between half life and time constant."
- "Many candidates listed a number of context sensitive half times for various drugs without discussing why the numbers occurred and this attracted minimal marks."
- "Whilst a large number of candidates mentioned that fentanyl has a long context sensitive half time following a prolonged infusion, due to it sequestration in fat stores, very few people discussed the case for short infusions of fentanyl where the CSHT is relatively short due to distribution from the plasma in to fat."
