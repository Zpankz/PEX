EC_expectedDomains:
- "Question 9 is a challenging question."
- "It asks the candidate to briefly compare characteristics of the pulmonary and systemic circulation."
- "It is important with a question like this to use several strategies: The first strategy is to utilize two columns for the comparison, one labelled systemic circulation and the other pulmonary circulation."
- "The second is to outline the comparisons in a summarized fashion as there are potentially many facts to discuss in a 10 minute time frame."
- "These include anatomy (macroscopic and microscopic), typical physiological variables (numeric with brief written rationale), blood flow distribution (referring to effects of gravity, anatomical pressures in thorax and cardiac and breathing cycle influences), determinants of vascular resistance (differential influence of gases, pH, arterial pressures, hormones, metabolic, autonomic), as well as predominant function and special functions of the two circulations."
