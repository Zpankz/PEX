title: "Describe the sites of action of antiemetic agents used for post operative nausea and vomiting."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2015
sitting: B
question: 6
passRate: 47
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Main points expected for a pass: • A description or diagram of the physiological pathways involved in the vomiting reflex. An example can be seen in one of the prescribed textbooks - Rang and Dale’s Pharmacology / H P Rang, et al - 8th ed, chapter 30."
- "An outline of the different receptors involved and an explanation of where they are located in the gastrointestinal tract, vestibular system, nucleus tractus solitarius, chemoreceptor trigger zone, and the vomiting centre."
- "A description of the different classes of antiemetics (with examples) and an explanation of where and how they act within the CNS/periphery."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional points that attracted higher marks: • Extra marks were given to candidates who discussed the antiemetic effects of propofol, steroids (particularly dexamethasone), benzodiazepines, neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, and cannabinoids. Although the mechanisms of action of propofol and dexamethasone are not fully described, credit was given if the candidate mentioned a postulated mechanism."
- "An appreciation that some antiemetics work at several sites, and have effects on more than one receptor (e.g. metaclopramide, chlorpromazine)."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates spent time describing the incidence and risk factors of PONV, which did not attract any marks."
- "Poor descriptions/diagrams of the vomiting reflex."
- "Confusion about which receptors (and subtypes) are involved and their locations."
- "A simple list of antiemetics scored some marks but was not enough to secure a pass-mark."
- "Spelling errors and use of drug trade-names instead of generic terms."
- "The use of vague and imprecise statements without providing further detail or discussion. E.g. “metoclopramide acts centrally and peripherally”."
- "Missing out several classes of antiemetics."
