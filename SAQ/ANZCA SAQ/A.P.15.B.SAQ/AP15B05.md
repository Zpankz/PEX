title: "Describe how morbid obesity affects time to awakening after inhalation anaesthesia."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2015
sitting: B
question: 5
passRate: 34
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A pass mark required some definition of morbid obesity (correctly described) and its physiological, pharmacological and anatomical consequences as well as a description of time to awakening for example MAC-awake."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The better answers were structured to deal with: (1) the kinetics of recovery from inhalational anaesthesia, (2) the dynamic effects of obesity on anaesthesia and (3) patient factors related to obesity and the clinical application of inhalational anaesthesia."
- "Extra points were awarded if the answer included a wash-out graph or FA/FA0 curves (correctly labelled) or diagram of the compartments involved i.e. vessel-rich, muscle group and vessel poor or fat group."
- "Highly scoring answers also included correct values for oil: gas partition coefficients & tissue solubilities although these were rare."
- "Factors such as relationships of individual agents with regard to solubility in tissues & fat; duration of anaesthesia and end-tidal concentrations at the end of anaesthesia were required for a full answer."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Factors affecting recovery such as changes in cardiac output, perfusion of tissues and respiratory or ventilation changes were poorly understood or quite often incorrect."
- "Many answers simply lacked any content that indicated an understanding of either recovery from inhalational anaesthesia or the impact of morbid obesity."
- "Also, many answers included irrelevant information relating to intravenous anaesthetic agents and opioids, respiratory physiology or to the kinetics of induction and wash-in, particularly blood-gas partition coefficients."
