title: "List the components of soda lime, used for the absorption of carbon dioxide. Outline the hazards associated with the use of soda lime within a circle circuit and how the risks can be minimised."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2015
sitting: B
question: 2
passRate: 15
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question consisted of three components and all components required answering to pass."
- "The question asked for factors which decreased the production of Compound A and CO."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The better candidates listed the correct components of soda lime and showed a basic understanding of chemistry with correct formulae and knowledge of how pH indicators work."
- "Extra marks were awarded for understanding the role of silica and the importance of particle size in soda lime."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The chemical reactions in soda lime were not asked for nor the anatomy of the circle system."
- "Many candidates outlined the hazards of soda lime but not how to reduce these hazards."
- "The factors which increase the production of Compound A and CO were not awarded points."
- "There was confusion regarding fresh gas flow in relation to CO production; high fresh gas flow desiccates soda lime predisposing to CO production but will also decrease the CO in a circuit when attached to a patient by flushing it out."
