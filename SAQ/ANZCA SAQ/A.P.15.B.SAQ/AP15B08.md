college: ANZCA

question: 8
passRate: 63
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question requested a physiological outline incorporating basic sciences to explain this normal intraoperative occurrence."
- "Answers that were based on the basics of Glomerular Filtration Rate and Tubular Reabsorption and how these are altered by the clinical situation and neuro-humoural responses scored well."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "However, answers that were based on generic pre-renal, renal and post-renal causes of oliguria often strayed into an imprecise clinical discussion ignoring the basic science physiological changes that were requested and did not score well."
- "This was different to the responses provided by candidates in the previous examination when the examiners report stated that this was a successful answer plan in that cohort."
- "Once again, discussions of pathology and surgical misadventure went unrewarded as the question states that the patient is otherwise well."
