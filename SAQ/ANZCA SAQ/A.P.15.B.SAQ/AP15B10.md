title: "Outline how hyperventilation may reduce intracranial pressure."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2015
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 40
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question was answered by the majority of candidates with broad knowledge of the effect on CO2 on cerebral circulation."
- "Expected for a pass mark was: • an understanding that ICP was a product of intracranial contents and how these varied as discussed by the Monroe-Kellie doctrine • an accurate indication of what hyperventilation was and how this effected PaCO2 and hence cerebral PaCO2 • a discussion of the effect of CO2 on cerebral vasculature • an indication of the extent of this effect (either verbally or by a correctly drawn graph)"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for: • discussing the mechanism of CO2 effects via H+ ion mediated regulation and the limits of this effect • demonstrating an understanding of the effects that changes in vascular calibre had on flow and pressures in the cranium as described by the Hagen–Poiseuille equation • describing additive effects of hypoxia when added to that of cerebral hypocarbia and the potentially protective effects of hyperventilation in this • additive effects of hyperventilation induced decreases in intrathoracic pressure on ICP"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common problems candidates demonstrated with this question included: • Poorly drawn and unlabeled or incorrectly labelled graphs • graphs and sentences that contradicted each other • a lack of detail, or incorrect details, regarding the extent of ventilatory effects on the cerebral circulation"
