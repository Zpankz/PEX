title: "Describe the physiological factors that contribute to the competence and tone of the lower oesophageal sphincter."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2015
sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 32
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Main points expected were: Devoid of true sphincteric muscles, the terminal 4 cm of the oesophagus functions as a physiological sphincter."
- "Anatomically, it is indistinguishable from the upper portions."
- "This is contributed by: • Increased number of nerve cells providing tonic contraction of circular smooth muscles in the internal layer of the lower oesophagus. • The pinch-cock mechanism from crural fibres of the diaphragm which wraps the oesophagus and pinching it closed during muscular contraction. • Flap-valve mechanism at the gastro-oesophageal junction from gastric mucosal folds closing the orifice when the stomach is distended. • Oblique entry of the oesophagus into the stomach preventing retrograde flow. • Intra-abdominal position of the gastro-oesophageal junction which subjects the lower oesophagus to intra-abdominal pressure."
- "Candidates were expected to demonstrate an understanding of the concept of barrier pressure, neural innervation and the effects of various hormones."
- "Also expected was a discussion of physical factors such as increased gastric acidity and increased intra-abdominal pressure."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were given if candidates were able to correctly relate how changes in physiology alter the tone of the lower oesophageal sphincter tone."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most failures were due to inadequate knowledge and incorrect information."
- "Features of some poor answers: • Confusion with factors affecting gastric emptying • A format based on patient, anaesthetic and surgical factors which fail to address physiological factors • Listing of pharmacological factors (which was not requested) • Regurgitation of irrelevant facts (such as the ability to measure the oesophageal tone with a manometer)"
