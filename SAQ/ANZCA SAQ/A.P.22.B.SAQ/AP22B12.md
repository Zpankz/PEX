title: "Classify diuretics, giving examples and briefly explaining their mechanisms of action. (50.9%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2022
sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 50
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main domains assessed in this question were commonly encountered classes of diuretic agents in clinical anaesthesia such as loop diuretics, thiazides, potassium sparing and osmotic diuretics."
- "Diuretics increase the rate of urine flow and sodium excretion and are used in disease states such as heart failure or hypertension to adjust extracellular fluid volume."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Credit was awarded for the correct site of action for each class of diuretic drug within the nephron as well as the correct target cellular mechanism for altering sodium and water excretion."
- "Both SGLT2 inhibitors and Vaptans do have diuretic effects. The inclusion of these drug groups was not needed to pass; however marks were awarded for this information provided that enough detail was also included on the core diuretic groups listed above."
- "Useful answer formats included an annotated diagram of a nephron with the correctly labelled sites of action or answers in the form of a table."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common mistakes were incorrect site of action or mechanism of action and inadequate breadth of drug classes."
