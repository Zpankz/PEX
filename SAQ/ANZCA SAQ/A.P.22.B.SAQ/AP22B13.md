EC_expectedDomains:
- "The scalp EEG is a complex electrical signal which derives from the cortex of the brain, with added signal from overlying muscle (EMG) and eyes (EOG)."
- "The cortical component is generated by the summation of excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials in cortical pyramidal cells (perpendicular to the electrodes)."
- "BIS and Entropy use a frontal electrode array and therefore analyze the frontal lobe EEG."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers described the characteristic EEG changes induced by these agents and how different methods of analysis quantify them – namely time-domain analysis (e.g., burst suppression) and frequency domain analysis (e.g. Fourier analysis leading to \"beta ratio\", \"spectral edge frequency\", \"bi-coherence\" or \"spectral entropy\")."
- "Good coverage of this topic can be found in the latest editions of Miller and Power + Kam."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This was a question with two parts:"
- "Part (a) (which was generally better answered) required an acceptable description of the awake EEG. This is typically a low-amplitude, high-frequency, random (de-synchronised) waveform. Better answers contained more detail and correct information about expected values and units, with a breakdown of the main frequency bands that contribute to the signal, and a discussion of the influence of EMG and EOG activity."
- "Part (b) required an understanding of how these devices generate their index values. In broad terms, they measure the ratio of power in different frequency bands on the front of the head. These “subparameters” are then used with the device to generate an index number which reflects the loss of frontalis muscle tone and how much the GABAergic drugs are hyperpolarizing the thalamo- cortical system. This number may have some correlation with drug delivery and unconsciousness."
- "The most common issues leading to a low mark were a general lack of detail and explanation, imprecise statements and errors."
- "Descriptions of EEG generation were often vague, inaccurate, or incomplete."
- "Frequency bands were often mixed up and units incorrect (particularly amplitude)."
- "Methods of EEG analysis were often listed – with little detail or description of their relevance."
- "Stating the reference ranges for the BIS and Entropy index is not an explanation of how the index is generated."
- "Although there is limited information from manufacturers on precisely how their devices calculate the indexes, only a general understanding of the principles was required for a pass in the second section."
