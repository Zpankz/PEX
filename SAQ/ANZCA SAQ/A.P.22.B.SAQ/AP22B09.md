title: "Compare and contrast the pharmacology of esmolol and labetalol. (69.7%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2022
sitting: B
question: 9
passRate: 69
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question was a test of factual knowledge regarding two related drugs and an exploration of the understanding of the action and effects of beta and alpha blockade."
- "Differences in metabolism and patterns of side effects were also relevant."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Answers presented in a table format with one vertical column for each drug provided the most logical synthesis of information and the clearest comparisons between the two."
- "Precision in nomenclature of beta selectivity and alpha selectivity was rewarded. Descriptors such as beta1 or beta2 or alpha1 were less ambiguous than \"cardiac selective\" or \"nonselective\"."
- "Discussions of pharmacodynamics that included both action (adrenergic receptor antagonism, second messengers) and effect (impact on the HR, contractility, SVR, cardiac output) scored higher than general statements like \"used to treat hypertension or tachycardia\"."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Few candidates noted that labetalol is associated with a relatively preserved cardiac output compared with esmolol, due to its alpha1-antagonism-mediated reduction in SVR."
