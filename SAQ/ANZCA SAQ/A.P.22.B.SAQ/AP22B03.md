title: "Outline the factors that influence recovery and reversal following non-depolarising neuromuscular blockade. (18.8%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2022
sitting: B
question: 3
passRate: 18
EC_expectedDomains:
- "the concept of different non-depolarising muscle relaxants having varying durations of action and"
- "the reasons why this is so,"
- "the role of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and drug interactions including reversal agents."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "the inclusion of tangential topics that attracted no marks but prevented candidates from discussing more pertinent factors. For example: lengthy introductions, descriptions about clinical decision making for adequate reversal and generalised comments about pharmacokinetics that were not associated with variation in recovery."
- "The main reason for not reaching a pass was more often a lack of detail rather than incorrect statements. This could be improved by candidates answering the question more directly and avoiding digressions."
