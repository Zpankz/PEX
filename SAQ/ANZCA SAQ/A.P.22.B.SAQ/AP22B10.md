title: "Briefly outline the differences between the pulmonary circulation and the systemic circulation. (53.0%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2022
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 53
EC_expectedDomains:
- "anatomy"
- "haemodynamic variables"
- "blood flow distribution"
- "vascular resistance"
- "functions"
EC_extraCredit:
- "The easiest way to do this succinctly is by using a table structure with the circulatory feature (e.g. function) and then columns for both ‘Pulmonary’ and ‘Systemic’. This not only saves valuable time in re-writing ‘pulmonary’ and ‘systemic’ repeatedly but allows for comparison between the systems and helps ensure information about each domain listed by the candidate is mentioned for both circulations."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This is a challenging question in that it requires a reasonable volume of information to be conveyed in a short time frame."
- "only addressing one or two of the domains"
- "listing information without any physiological context or effect (e.g. “pO2 affects resistance” rather than mentioning low pO2 causes pulmonary vasoconstriction/increases resistance)"
- "differences in blood flow and factors affecting regional blood flow were routinely omitted"
- "only mentioning one factor that affected resistance"
