title: "Describe the ionic basis of automaticity in the pacemaker cells of the sino-atrial node. (61.1%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2022
sitting: B
question: 11
passRate: 61
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The domains assessed and the expectations for a pass mark were published in the corresponding exam report and remain unchanged."
EC_extraCredit:
- "This question was most recently asked in the 2020.1 primary exam."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates were able to pass this question (and there were a handful of exceptionally good answers), however the pass rate was lower this time compared to 2020.1."
- "describing the sino-atrial node action potential (often correctly and in intricate detail) without any mention of automaticity or the factors affecting it"
- "imprecise or incorrect definitions of automaticity"
- "factual errors with regards to the various phases, ion channels and direction of ion fluxes"
- "addressing irrelevant topics (e.g. the resting membrane potential)"
- "referring to phase 4 as having a “wandering baseline” (as opposed to a spontaneous and gradual depolarization)"
- "simplistic explanations for factors affecting automaticity (e.g. writing “SNS increases HR”)"
