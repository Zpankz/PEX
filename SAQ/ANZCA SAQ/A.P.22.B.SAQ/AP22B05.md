title: "Justify the dose of propofol you would expect to induce anaesthesia in the following scenarios, using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles. a) 75-year-old weighing 70 kg b) 40-year-old weighing 70 kg with severe hypovolaemic shock (52.1%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2022
sitting: B
question: 5
passRate: 52
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A pass for this question required an appropriate dosing regimen for propofol based on pharmacokinetic and dynamic principles."
- "Induction doses needed to be clinically appropriate and safe."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Details on each of these aspects were expected where relevant, and the better answers displayed clear understanding and some depth of information."
- "better candidates were able to correctly discuss techniques to avoid the potential side effects of using propofol to induce anaesthesia in a shocked patient."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "there was a degree of confusion of the relative effects of the changed ratio of total body water and body fat that occurs with aging and the impact that this has on the volume of distribution of propofol."
- "Some candidates gave a wide range of doses in this part of the answer and clinically may be less ideal."
- "the difference between co induction (to utilise synergistic effects of agents and use small doses of each agent) and addition of agents to an already appropriate dose of a drug (that will further increase the effect and possibly increase the deleterious side effect profile of the drugs used) was a point of confusion in many answers."
- "Those answers that provided unapplied lists of generic pharmacokinetic and dynamic parameters were not awarded marks for this information."
