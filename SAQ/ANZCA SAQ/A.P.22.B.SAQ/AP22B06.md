title: "Discuss factors that determine the time to awakening after cessation of a sevoflurane anaesthetic (55.6%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2022
sitting: B
question: 6
passRate: 55
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question required a description of the movement of sevoflurane down its partial pressure gradient so that the effect site partial pressure falls below the level required for hypnosis."
- "Multiple factors influence the rate of this decrement; these needed to be described and quantified where possible."
- "The context sensitivity of sevoflurane and the reasons for it needed to be mentioned."
- "This question also required a discussion of the pharmacodynamic factors which alter sensitivity to sevoflurane (and therefore influence wake-up time), some candidates who could otherwise have scored well entirely neglected this section and focused solely on the pharmacokinetic determinants of the shape of the washout curve."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates are reminded to refer to recent past exam papers and the examiner's reports."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "it was very rare for a candidate to mention any likely wake-up time after a sevoflurane anaesthetic."
- "washout curves were commonly drawn with no time units, with a shape representing a single exponential function, or with incorrect labelling of the ‘parts’ of the curve. Incorrect graphs did not add to the answer. Accurate washout curves can be found in Miller’s Anesthesia 9e chapter 20."
- "Many candidates made general statements alluding to equilibration times or compartment time constants without supplying any numbers. While stating the concepts was necessary, vague statements do not score well."
- "where compartment time constants were discussed, the expression cardiac output was often incorrectly used instead of tissue blood flow."
