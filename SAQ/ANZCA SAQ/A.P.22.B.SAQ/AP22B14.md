title: "Describe the maternal cardiovascular changes that occur during pregnancy. (60.7%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2022
sitting: B
question: 14
passRate: 60
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Elements required for a pass included"
- "the direction and magnitude of change in pregnancy of the major CVS parameters"
- "some explanation of the mechanisms behind these changes"
- "a description of the aortocaval syndrome"
EC_extraCredit:
- "In general, candidates who were able to demonstrate the changes of major cardiovascular parameters graphically over the course of 40 weeks did better overall"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates who provided the correct direction and magnitude of change of CVS parameters but did not provide some description of the mechanisms behind these changes were unable to pass."
- "Some candidates made factual statements about the physiology of pregnancy but did not clearly link these to the cardiovascular parameters."
- "Some candidates neglected to mention the aortocaval syndrome or provided an incomplete description (i.e., only described the “caval” half of the aortocaval syndrome)."
- "Several candidates confused haematocrit with haemoglobin or confused absolute amounts with concentrations. Absolute haemoglobin amounts increase in pregnancy but haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit decrease due to the differential rate of plasma volume:red cell mass increase."
- "Descriptions of pathophysiology (e.g. pre-eclampsia) did not attract marks."
