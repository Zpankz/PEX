title: "Describe the role of carbon dioxide in the control of ventilation (65.8%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2022
sitting: B
question: 8
passRate: 65
EC_expectedDomains:
- "CO2 production is proportional to metabolic rate"
- "CO2 levels are tightly regulated via controlling minute ventilation in a typical sensor- controller-effector negative feedback loop"
- "a description of the peripheral and central chemoreceptors, and their relative importance"
- "recognition of a separate integrator consisting of the brainstem respiratory groups"
- "and effectors consisting of the muscles of inspiration and expiration leading to changes in tidal volume and respiratory rate"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Credit was also given for more detailed descriptions and/or the effects from other relevant factors such as anaesthesia, opioids, hypoxia, acidosis, and exercise on CO2 ventilatory control."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "In general, this question was well answered by most candidates."
- "Common errors included stating SNS output primarily led to increased alveolar ventilation."
- "Candidates are also reminded that CO2 response curves are derived in laboratory settings with increasing FiCO2, whereas in healthcare settings an increased PaCO2 almost always occurs as a result of decreased minute volumes; few answers could succinctly resolve this issue."
