title: "Neuraxial anatomy question booklet (unpublished) (81.5%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2022
sitting: B
question: 1
passRate: 81
EC_expectedDomains:
- "surface anatomy relevant to landmarks for neuraxial blocks"
- "vertebral body anatomy"
- "ligaments traversed by an epidural needle with a midline approach"
- "boundaries of the epidural space and contents thereof"
- "factors which increase epidural venous plexus volume and the clinical implications of an increase in venous plexus volume"
EC_extraCredit:
- "answer the question asked. Candidates were asked for posterior surface anatomy landmarks. No credit was given for anterior surface anatomy."
- "if asked to list a specific number of factors (eg 3), that number of answers will be marked. No credit will be given for further material. Candidates should prioritise the information included rather than using a scattergun approach."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "very poor knowledge in general of surface anatomy landmarks."
- "difficulty in identifying features of a vertebra, especially the lamina, pedicle and transverse process."
- "there was a poor understanding of how raised intra-abdominal pressure or IVC obstruction increased the volume of the epidural venous plexus and the importance of the system being valveless and thus allowing backflow of blood and potential drainage via the azygos and hemi-azygos veins."
