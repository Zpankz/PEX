title: "Discuss the factors that determine glomerular filtration rate (GFR). (47.0%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2022
sitting: B
question: 7
passRate: 47
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This is a straightforward physiology question best answered using the Starling equation as the core framework, although the equation was often inaccurately reproduced by candidates."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Discussion of pathological process that influence glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were only awarded marks if correctly linked back to the underlying physiology."
- "Better answers correctly discussed tubuloglomerular feedback and how this alters the Starling equation to keep GFR within narrow limits, as well as providing normal values for the Starling equation."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "It was difficult to pass this question without demonstrating an understanding of this core physiological principle."
- "A frequent error was asserting that renal blood flow (RBF) directly determines GFR by conflating the common factors that influence both."
- "Unfortunately, many candidates structured their entire answer on the determinants of RBF rather than GFR."
- "Discussion on clinical measurements of GFR were not awarded marks unless linked back to the question."
