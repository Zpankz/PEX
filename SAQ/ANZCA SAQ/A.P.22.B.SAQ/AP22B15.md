title: "Using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles, briefly outline the mechanisms of drug interactions, providing relevant examples (45.7%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2022
sitting: B
question: 15
passRate: 45
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The domains of this question were to discuss drug-drug interactions which were"
- "pharmacokinetic - absorption, distribution, metabolism (in particular cytochrome p450 interactions), and elimination with examples and"
- "pharmacodynamic - principles of agonism and antagonism leading to drug interaction:◦ Agonism – additive, synergistic, infra-additive◦ Antagonism – Competitive, non-competitive"
EC_extraCredit:
- "correctly drawn isobologram"
- "correctly drawn diagram to illustrate antagonism by antagonist drugs and partial agonist drugs."
- "giving multiple examples"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "not discussing both parts (pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic) of the question."
- "discussing drug-receptor interaction explaining mechanism of actions of different drugs rather than describing drug-to-drug interaction."
- "giving non-specific answers."
- "using examples that were incorrect"
