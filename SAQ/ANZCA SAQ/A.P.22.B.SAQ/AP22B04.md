title: "40 mL of 0.75% ropivacaine has been given to a 60 kg 80-year-old patient during a brachial plexus block. a) What dose of ropivacaine (in milligrams) has been given? How does this compare to the safe maximal dose? b) Briefly outline the features of the local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) which may develop. c) Briefly outline the underlying mechanisms of LAST. Do not discuss treatment. (59.0%)"

EC_expectedDomains:
- "This is a core pharmacology topic with significant real-life ramifications. The domains are as listed in the question."
EC_extraCredit:
- "In addition to mentioning the contribution of sodium channel blockade to toxicity, credit was awarded for mention of the contribution of K+ channel and Ca2+ channel blockade and the effect on mitochondria."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates were able to identify this as a toxic dose of ropivacaine with significant risk of precipitating LAST."
- "Few candidates identified, or gave details about, this patient’s increased risk given her age."
- "Most candidates adequately described the biphasic CNS symptoms seen in LAST but fewer identified or described the same phenomenon that occurs with CVS symptoms (initially tachycardia/hypertension preceding hypotension/arrhythmia)."
- "Many answers mentioned CC:CNS ratio but didn’t describe it in any detail. There was significant leeway given for CC:CNS ratios and toxic plasma concentrations due to differences in the texts."
