exam: PEX
college: ANZCA

sitting: B
question: 1
passRate: 86
EC_expectedDomains:
- "responses to 30% blood volume loss"
- "contextualising the degree of volume loss"
- "baroreceptors"
- "sympathetic nervous system responses"
- "immediate endocrine responses (e.g. vasoconstriction via ATII)"
- "effects of sevoflurane (focusing on how sevoflurane would interfere with homeostatic responses to haemorrhage)"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail / nuanced discussion"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "as on previous occasions, the second part of this question often lacked enough detail"
- "many candidates did not appreciate the dose dependent effects of sevoflurane"
- "some candidates did not convey enough understanding of the significance of 30% blood volume loss"
