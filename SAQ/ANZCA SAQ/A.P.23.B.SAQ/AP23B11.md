title: "a) Explain why a bolus dose of an opioid is commonly used as part of the induction of anaesthesia. b) Describe the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl and alfentanil relevant to their use as in part (a)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 11
passRate: 45
EC_expectedDomains:
- "reasons for opioid bolus at induction"
- "for example – synergism with other induction agents, reduction in dose of induction agent, blunt sympathetic response to intubation, blunt cough and airway reflexes (LMA), facilitate IPPV, analgesia (intra- and post-operative)"
- "pharmacokinetics"
- "the time to peak effect of a bolus of fentanyl is approximately 5 minutes, and alfentanil 90 secs – therefore both are suitably timed to use at induction o explaining onset times using pharmacokinetics, especially"
- "potency (therefore dose given)"
- "pKa (therefore % un-ionised)"
- "explaining offset after a bolus"
EC_extraCredit:
- "nuanced discussion with clinical context"
- "detailed PK explanation"
- "more detail about the diffusible fraction including % plasma protein binding"
- "explaining the apparent paradox with the higher lipid solubility of fentanyl"
- "describing specific plasma concentrations and durations of effect produced by different bolus doses of each drug, with examples of when this might be relevant"
- "explaining why fentanyl has a longer duration of effect despite having a higher clearance"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "not answering both parts adequately"
- "part (a)"
- "discussing the cellular mechanism of action of opioids, and the pain pathways"
- "little or no discussion of part (a) but discussing part (b) extensively"
- "many candidates did not mention blunting airway reflexes, or respiratory depression"
- "part (b)"
- "discussing different modes of administration, other than IV bolus at induction"
- "offset after a bolus was frequently omitted"
- "discussing opioids other than fentanyl and alfentanil"
- "listing pharmacokinetic data without explanation"
