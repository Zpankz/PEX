title: "a) Interpret the following arterial blood gas results, taken from a pregnant woman at term. pH 7.45, PaO2 105 mmHg (14 kPa), PaCO2 32 mmHg (4.3 kPa), HCO3- 22 mmol/L b) Describe the mechanisms which cause the above changes (compared with an ABG in a non-pregnant woman)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 4
passRate: 32
EC_expectedDomains:
- "interpretation ‚Äì a normal ABG for term pregnancy (compensated respiratory alkalosis)"
- "mechanisms"
- "‚Üì PaCO2 due to progesterone effect on respiratory centre increasing MV"
- "‚Üì HCO3 due to renal compensation for the ‚Üì PaCO2, to normalise pH"
- "‚Üë PaO2 due to the increased ventilation"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail about mechanisms"
- "good answers acknowledged that the increased MV is slightly greater than required by the ùëâÃá CO2, and provided a rationale"
- "linking the mechanisms with their physiological role"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "not basing the answer around the ABG being normal for a term pregnancy"
- "incorrect ABG interpretation and/or not knowing the normal ranges for the ABG values"
- "not explaining the changes in HCO3 and PaO2 results, or providing only a very cursory explanation"
- "discussing changes in maternal respiratory physiology (e.g. lung volumes, mechanics, double Bohr and Haldane effects) without any reference to the ABG results"
- "misunderstandings about the shifts in OHDC in pregnancy"
