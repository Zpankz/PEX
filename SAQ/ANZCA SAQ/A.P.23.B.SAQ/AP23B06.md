- "physiological barrier pressure"
- "altered physiology / pathophysiology"
- "e.g. pregnancy, neonate, elderly, hiatus hernia, GORD, cricoid pressure"
- "drugs"
- "examples which either increase or decrease LOS tone"
EC_extraCredit:
- "breadth of answer"
- "more detail (e.g. specific hormone and autonomic effects; multiple drug examples)"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "confusion about the ‘pinch cock’ and ‘flap valve’ anatomical arrangement of the LOS"
