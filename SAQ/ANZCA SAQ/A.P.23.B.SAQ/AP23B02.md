title: "Compare and contrast myocardial oxygen supply to the left and right ventricles."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 2
passRate: 68
EC_expectedDomains:
- "noting the similarities and differences between the LV and RV for the domains below"
- "phasic nature of coronary blood flow, and the determinants of coronary perfusion pressure"
- "coronary artery anatomy"
- "autoregulation / control of coronary blood flow o arterial oxygen content"
EC_extraCredit:
- "a graph assisted with the explanation of LV and RV coronary blood flow"
- "breadth of answer"
- "more detail"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "not comparing/contrasting the LV and RV (or failing to mention the RV at all)"
- "stating that coronary blood flow to the LV occurs only during diastole (it is predominantly in diastole)"
- "labelling the y-axis of the coronary blood flow diagram with mmHg (it should be mL/min)"
- "confusion about the role of the autonomic nervous system"
- "discussing factors that affect myocardial oxygen demand â€“ this only scored marks if mentioned in the context of increasing supply via metabolic autoregulation (this question specifically focused on supply)"
