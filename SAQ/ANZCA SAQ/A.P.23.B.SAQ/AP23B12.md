title: "Describe the factors determining the speed of onset of neuromuscular blocking drugs."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 46
EC_expectedDomains:
- "pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic factors"
- "multiples of ED95, drug potency (including molar potency) and dose, presence of antagonists, priming dose, cardiac output"
- "suxamethonium – speed of onset related to its different mechanism of action o muscle group differences"
- "effect of pathology"
EC_extraCredit:
- "breadth of answer"
- "more detail"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "confusion about drug potency and plasma concentration"
- "specific examples of expected onset times were often lacking"
- "confusion about the effect of cardiac output on onset time"
- "confusion about muscle types / nACh receptor density, and onset time"
- "many candidates wrote long introductory paragraphs on muscle relaxants which did not address the question"
- "including diagrams – usually these did not add anything to the information already written"
