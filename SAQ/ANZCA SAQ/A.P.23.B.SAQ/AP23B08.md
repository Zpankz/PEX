entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 8
passRate: 71
EC_expectedDomains:
- "3 compartment model drawn accurately, showing V1, V2, V3, effect site, and corresponding rate constants (including ke0)"
- "descriptions of the above components"
- "similarities and differences between Marsh and Schnider models"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail"
- "some candidates had extensive knowledge of each algorithmâ€™s parameters"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "most candidates produced an adequate diagram but descriptions were sometimes sparse or inaccurate"
- "omitting elimination from V1"
- "limited or no discussion of rate constants"
- "stating pharmacological compartments = anatomical compartments"
- "inaccurate description of ke0 and its relevance"
- "part (b) was less well answered"
- "not mentioning plasma or effect site targeting for each TCI model o not mentioning differences in V1 and loading dose"
- "not discussing elimination as a factor in either algorithm"
- "how obesity and age affect accuracy"
