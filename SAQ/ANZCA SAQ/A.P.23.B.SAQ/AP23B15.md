title: "Briefly outline the principles of measuring cardiac output, using Doppler ultrasound."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 15
passRate: 34
EC_expectedDomains:
- "how velocity is measured using Doppler"
- "it was possible to pass without reproducing the Doppler equation, if correct understanding was otherwise shown"
- "writing the Doppler equation without any explanation was not sufficient"
- "processing a pulsatile velocity signal to obtain cardiac output"
- "obtain stroke distance by calculating area under the velocity time curve (VTI)"
- "multiply by cross sectional area to obtain stroke volume"
- "multiply by heart rate to obtain cardiac output"
EC_extraCredit:
- "information about how ultrasound waves are generated"
- "detail about velocity measurement"
- "illustrating the above concepts by describing clinical measurement techniques
(e.g. echocardiography or transoesophageal Doppler)"
- "discussing errors or assumptions with clinical measurement techniques"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "many candidates wrote extensively (or exclusively) about basic ultrasound principles or 2D ultrasound image generation"
- "the Doppler effect was often poorly described (or described using examples that are not applicable to this question), and a wide variety of incorrect Doppler equations were reproduced (some were confused with the Bernoulli equation)"
- "many candidates could not describe the steps in processing a pulsatile velocity signal to calculate cardiac output"
- "describing the use of colour Doppler to measure cardiac output"
- "conflation with Stewart-Hamilton equation, Fick principle, or Simpsonâ€™s method"
