entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 9
passRate: 43
EC_expectedDomains:
- "explanation of the concept of MAC (including different types of MAC)"
- "clinical utility of MAC"
- "discussion of factors which may increase or decrease MAC"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail"
- "using quantal dose-response curves to show EC95 at 1.2MAC, other types of MAC curves, MAC relative to hypnosis/amnesia, and comparisons between different agents"
- "clinical effects seen in relation to MAC, such as cerebral blood flow and uterine tone"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "many definitions of MAC were incomplete or inaccurate"
- "many answers did not reflect an understanding that MAC is a measure of the potency of inhalational agents"
- "very few candidates included a quantal dose-response curve in their answer to show that MAC is an EC50"
- "most discussions of clinical utility focused entirely on “preventing awareness”, and did not mention comparing equipotent concentrations of different agents; or calculating the additive effect of N2O plus a volatile"
- "Although most candidates could produce a list of factors which alter MAC, very few provided any discussion of these factors. It was expected that the effects of age (neonate and elderly), and co-administered drugs, would be discussed for a passing answer."
