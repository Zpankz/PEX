title: "Discuss the pharmacology of adrenaline (epinephrine), in relation to its use for anaphylaxis."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 61
EC_expectedDomains:
- "pharmacodynamics"
- "mechanism of action of adrenaline, linked to the pathophysiology of anaphylaxis"
- "CVS, respiratory, and airway effects"
- "stabilisation of mast cells"
- "naming the adrenergic receptor responsible for each effect"
- "dose"
- "appropriate adult IV and IM doses"
- "pharmacokinetics"
- "short half-life often requiring repeat dosing or infusion o Î²2 vasodilation in muscle facilitating IM absorption"
- "pharmaceutics"
- "understanding the 1:1,000 and 1:10,000 preparations"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail about mechanisms"
- "discussion of adverse effects (e.g. tachyarrhythmias, hypertension, myocardial ischaemia, hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, lactic acidosis)"
- "more detail with dosing regimes (especially when based on the grade of severity of anaphylaxis), infusions, or paediatric doses"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "discussing the general pharmacology of adrenaline, without tailoring the answer to anaphylaxis"
- "extensive discussion of the pathophysiology of anaphylaxis, with little or no information on pharmacology"
- "confusion between the different effects produced by arterial and venous constriction"
- "focusing only on the CVS effects of adrenaline"
- "discussing other treatments for anaphylaxis (the question was only about adrenaline)"
- "incorrect adrenaline doses"
- "Several candidates stated that adrenaline must only be given via a central line. This is incorrect. When treating anaphylaxis, anaesthetists must not delay adrenaline administration to put in a central line. Adrenaline can be given via a peripheral IV cannula. There is a potential risk of skin necrosis if extravasation occurs, but this is not a contraindication to using a peripheral cannula to give adrenaline. A central line can be inserted, if indicated, when time permits."
- "the EpiPen was mentioned only by a very small number of candidates"
