title: "a) List the intracranial contents which contribute to the intracranial pressure (ICP). (10% of marks) b) Briefly outline what is meant by the Monro-Kellie doctrine. (10% of marks) c) List the interventions that can be used to reduce raised ICP. For each intervention, outline the mechanism by which it works. (80% of marks)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 5
passRate: 58
EC_expectedDomains:
- "intracranial contents"
- "brain 80%, blood (arterial and venous) 10%, CSF 10% (variation was allowed with these percentages as they are approximate)"
- "Monro-Kellie doctrine"
- "a simple definition was required"
- "interventions that can reduce ICP (the list below is not exhaustive)"
- "↓ brain volume – hypertonic solutions (e.g. mannitol)"
- "↓ arterial volume – low normal PaCO2 / brief hyperventilation; ↓ CMRO2; correct hypoxaemia; correct hypotension (**see comments below); prevent hypertension (above autoregulation limit)"
- "↓ venous volume – elevate head, no PEEP, no coughing/straining on ETT, no tapes or cervical collars around neck"
- "↓ CSF – drainage via EVD"
- "↓ space occupying lesion"
EC_extraCredit:
- "breadth of answer"
- "detailed mechanisms"
- "decompressive craniotomy (if linked to the Monro-Kellie doctrine)"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some candidates spent too long answering parts (a) and (b) and not enough on part (c). The relative weighting of each section was specified in the question. One line could have sufficed for parts (a) and (b)."
- "**Some candidates claimed that they would induce hypotension to decrease ICP. This is a very serious error. Hypotension will further increase ICP via cerebral vasodilation (myogenic autoregulation). Furthermore, lowering the blood pressure will reduce cerebral perfusion pressure, resulting in brain ischaemia and further vasodilation (metabolic autoregulation). These points are illustrated in the diagram below. (In patients with raised ICP, we typically increase the blood pressure to ensure an adequate CPP.)"
- "Confusing the concepts of blood volume and blood flow."
- "Not addressing both intracranial arterial and venous blood volume."
