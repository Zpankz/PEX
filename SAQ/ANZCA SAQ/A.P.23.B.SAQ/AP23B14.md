title: "a) Using a labelled diagram, describe how a mechanical (non-cassette) variable bypass vaporiser achieves the concentration set on the dial. b) Explain the mechanisms that compensate for temperature changes."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 14
passRate: 58
EC_expectedDomains:
- "diagram – accurate, and correctly labelled"
- "principles of a variable bypass vaporiser"
- "temperature compensation"
- "heat capacity and thermal conductivity of vaporiser casing o strategies to alter splitting ratio (e.g. bimetallic strip)"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail in answer"
- "some candidates were able to derive splitting ratios from first principles"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "many candidates made erroneous statements that contradicted the basic laws of thermodynamics (e.g. describing vaporiser casing as “insulation”)"
- "the function of the heat sink was frequently misunderstood (heat capacity refers to the amount of heat energy (in Joules) present in a substance at a given temperature)"
- "no marks were awarded for discussion of a desflurane vaporiser – this is not variable bypass"
