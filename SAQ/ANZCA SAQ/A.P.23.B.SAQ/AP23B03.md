entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 3
passRate: 19
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Part (a)"
- "a simple definition of atelectasis was useful"
- "atelectasis causes a spectrum of low V/Q lung units including some with V/Q=0 (shunt)"
- "Shunt causes hypoxaemia through the addition of mixed venous blood to the arterial circulation. This dilutes the arterial oxygen content. The degree of hypoxaemia correlates with the size of the shunt."
- "In low V/Q areas, the alveolar PO2 will fall because O2 uptake is not matched by re- supply. If the PAO2 is decreased then the pulmonary capillary blood will have a lower oxygen content. This dilutes the final arterial oxygen content, but to a lesser degree than shunt."
- "atelectasis commonly occurs in dependent areas of the lungs and this contributes to the degree of hypoxaemia because these regions receive the greatest blood flow"
- "Part (b)"
- "the effect of low V/Q areas on arterial oxygenation can easily be corrected with supplemental oxygen, because these lung units are receiving some ventilation"
- "with shunt, the ability to correct hypoxaemia using increased FiO2 becomes progressively more limited as the shunt fraction increases"
- "The effects of shunt (and increased FiO2) can be shown using a 2 compartment lung model. Calculations need to be performed using oxygen content. A final arterial oxygen saturation can be determined using an OHDC with content on the y axis."
EC_extraCredit:
- "quantifying the effects of shunt, low V/Q, and supplemental oxygen, using diagrams or calculations such as Nunn 9th ed Fig 7.12 and 7.14"
- "showing understanding of the iso-shunt diagram"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "confusing or interchanging the terms shunt and dead space (a recurring problem with all questions asked about V/Q abnormalities)"
- "using imprecise terminology without evidence of understanding"
- "although most answers equated atelectasis with shunt, very few answers also addressed low V/Q lung units"
- "some candidates claimed that oxygen therapy has no effect in this situation – this contradicts the clinical reality seen daily in the operating room and PACU"
- "the iso-shunt diagram predicts a PaO2 of 100 mmHg with 100% oxygen in a 30% shunt"
- "with a 50% shunt, although a PaO2 100 mmHg can’t be achieved, this iso-shunt line is not horizontal"
- "While it is true to say that high V/Q regions are unable to compensate for low V/Q regions, this must be put in context – it refers to the normal physiology of a person breathing room air, and it explains why an alveolar-arterial O2 difference exists normally. We can’t extrapolate this statement to say that oxygen therapy has no effect in situations of low V/Q or shunt."
- "most candidates struggled to explain how supplemental oxygen actually works"
- "no marks were awarded for discussions of PEEP, CPAP, or high flow nasal oxygen"
