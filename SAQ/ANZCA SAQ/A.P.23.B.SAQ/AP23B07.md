title: "Describe Phase I and Phase II reactions in drug metabolism. Illustrate your answer using the following examples – morphine, tramadol, propofol."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 7
passRate: 23
EC_expectedDomains:
- "overall understanding of drug metabolism – the active biotransformation of a molecule to increase water solubility (polarity) and thereby increase excretion in the urine or bile
(metabolism may or may not decrease drug activity)"
- "Phase I"
- "adding or exposing a small polar group (often –OH)"
- "this increases polarity slightly, and may also provide the attachment point for a Phase II reaction (although not all Phase I are followed by a Phase II reaction) o commonly hydroxylation, oxidation, demethylation"
- "commonly catalysed by CYP450 enzymes"
- "Phase II"
- "joining (conjugating) a large polar molecule onto the drug"
- "this significantly increases polarity"
- "glucuronidation is the most important – glucuronide is synthesised in the liver from glucose, and joined to the drug usually at an –OH, via glucuronyl transferase"
- "often follows a Phase I reaction, but some drugs can go straight to Phase II if a suitable attachment point is already there (e.g. morphine)"
- "examples"
- "including one or two of the specified examples could pass, if correct understanding was demonstrated"
- "all 3 of the example drugs undergo both Phase I and Phase II metabolism"
- "no drawing of molecular structures was expected, even to obtain full marks"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail"
- "discussing all 3 examples"
- "including whether metabolites are active or inactive"
- "including CYP2D6 variations and how this affects tramadol"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "generally, there was poor overall understanding of drug metabolism"
- "many candidates were completely unable to describe the metabolism of any of the specified drug examples (all three are core to anaesthesia)"
- "confusion about CYP450 enzymes causing Phase II reactions"
- "many candidates overstated the implications of M3G (more applicable to rodents than humans)"
- "stating that all drug metabolism occurs only in the liver"
