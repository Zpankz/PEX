question: 6
passRate: 52
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main domains expected to be covered in this were (a) an accurate, labelled diagram of a capnograph, showing correctly labelled axes with the phases of the cycle clearly labelled; (b) a number of different pieces of information that can be obtained, with some description of the value of this information and (c) evidence from this of a recognition that the capnograph is used as a monitor of both the patient and equipment."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common problems encountered were: • Poor diagrams. Very few diagrams presented actually resembled a capnograph trace, with many rigid square waves being drawn. Axes were often unlabelled and many candidates took very little care to accurately demonstrate the phases. Identification of what is happening in the cycle beyond a simple ‘inspiration/expiration’ divide was expected. Books differ in how these are labelled and latitude was allowed here. • Many candidates attempted to argue that information from a capnograph can be directly used to calculate dead space either by substituting numbers into a Bohr equation or by using Fowler’s method, neither of which is the case. • Very few candidates listed use of a capnogram to confirm ETT position, or circuit patency and/or disconnections, and many could not give more than two examples of altered capnograph traces."
