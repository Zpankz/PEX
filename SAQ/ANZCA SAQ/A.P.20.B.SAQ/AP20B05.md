title: "Describe the determinants of left ventricular myocardial oxygen supply and demand."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2020
sitting: B
question: 5
passRate: 62
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question required discussion of both the factors affecting supply of blood to the left ventricle, and the capacity of blood to carry oxygen, to be discussed in some depth."
- "Factors that influenced demand by the heart are primarily rate, contractility and systolic wall tension."
EC_extraCredit:
- "This question was answered succinctly and well by a number of candidates."
- "A brief description of the anatomy and normal rate of blood flow to the heart or LV normal blood flow as a proportion of total cardiac output was used by many candidates as a starting point to this question."
- "Equations relating to coronary perfusion pressure and the oxygen flux equation were correctly used by the better candidates to achieve this. Recognising and discussing that supply to the left ventricle was flow limited was done by most passing candidates."
- "Preload has a lesser effect and was discussed by the better candidates. Equations relating wall tension to radius ( Laplaceâ€™s Law ) and metabolic and myogenic factors that regulated both supply and demand were important parts of this answer. The effect of heart rate on filling time and perfusion was also relevant. Examples of pathology were used effectively by some candidates to describe states where demand was altered."
