title: "500ml of 20% mannitol is administered intravenously to a neurosurgical patient. Outline the cerebral, circulatory and renal effects including potential problems associated with its use."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2020
sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 42
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The expected domains in the answer were: • mechanism of action of mannitol as an osmotic agent (this explanation could have been incorporated within the other domains below, or included under a separate heading) • cerebral effects • circulatory effects • renal effects • problems associated with its use (especially cerebral, circulatory and renal)"
- "The intended effects, and associated problems, needed to be addressed appropriately to achieve a pass."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Similar to previous examination reports, confusion appears to have occurred with the phasic nature of the cardiovascular changes, and the mechanism of the diuretic effect. The misconceptions about the mechanism of reducing intracranial pressure were of concern (with many candidates suggesting this was secondary to decreased blood volume). Candidates are reminded to be specific in the description of intracellular, extracellular, intravascular and interstitial fluid in a discussion of osmotic effects. Few candidates described the effects on blood viscosity, and how this might affect cerebral blood flow."
