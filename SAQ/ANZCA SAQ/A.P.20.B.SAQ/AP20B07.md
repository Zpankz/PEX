title: "Describe the effect of pregnancy, at term, on wash-in of volatile anaesthetic agents"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2020
sitting: B
question: 7
passRate: 52
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The important physiological parameters that change in pregnancy which must be discussed to pass this question are minute ventilation, functional residual capacity and cardiac output."
- "For each of these parameters the candidate should indicate • why they change in pregnancy • the degree of change at term • the effect this change has upon wash in (increased/decreased rate) • an explanation as to the mechanism by which the effect upon wash in is mediated"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Discussion of all physiological changes in pregnancy, or of all factors related to volatile wash in, were not necessary. However, brief points which demonstrated greater understanding would include • Ventilation under GA usually not patient controlled at term - MV controlled by anaesthetist • Increased A-V gradient due to greater tissue uptake (uteroplacental unit) slows wash in • Nitrous Oxide has a prominent role in obstetric anaesthesia and enhances volatile wash in • Aorto-caval compression may lead to reduced rather than elevated cardiac output if supine • Kinetics of more soluble agents is more affected by the physiological changes than less soluble agents"
- "Time constants were referred to by some candidates. The time constant representing volatile wash in (FRC/MV) should ideally be accompanied by a brief note explaining its significance...that this implies the time needed for wash in will be less when a smaller volume (FRC) is being filled by a higher flow rate (MV)."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The rate of volatile wash in is determined by delivery of agent to the alveoli and uptake from the alveoli, and can be illustrated via FA/FI curves."
- "Many candidates misquoted the formula as MV/FRC, and/or suggested that a higher time constant reflected faster wash in."
- "Other common errors included discussion or labelling of FI/FA curves rather than FA/FI, and the terms delivery/uptake/wash in/onset were often used incorrectly or interchangeably."
