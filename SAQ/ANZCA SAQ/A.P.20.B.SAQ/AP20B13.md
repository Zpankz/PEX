title: "Describe the principles (50%) and sources of error (50%) in the measurement of arterial blood pressure using an invasive arterial line and transducer"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2020
sitting: B
question: 13
passRate: 39
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The first part of the question required candidates to discuss the principles of operation of arterial pressure measurement systems. To achieve a pass in this section candidates were expected to list the components of the system and describe the function of each component. A discussion of the broad principles of transducer operation was expected"
- "To achieve a pass in the second part of the question, candidates needed to demonstrate an understanding of the major sources of error in the arterial pressure monitoring system. These are primarily transducer zeroing, the effect of transducer height relative to the patient, and the effects and interplay of resonance and damping."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers included a discussion of signal amplification and possible mechanisms of setting the zero point. Specifically, a description of the Wheatstone bridge was not required for a pass, but was often included, with accompanying diagram which was, unfortunately, frequently incomplete or incorrect. The inclusion of accurate diagrams to illustrate understanding of the topic is encouraged, however significant errors tend to detract from the answer. Better answers generally included greater detail of design features of each component, for example indicating important aspects of tubing and cannula selection such as length and compliance, transducer design and the properties of complex wave propagation in fluids."
- "Good answers included a definition of each source of error, a description of the effect of introducing each source of error on the arterial waveform or reading and design features of the system which minimise each source of error. Additional credit was awarded for advanced understanding."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many answers consisted of an incomplete list of components of the system with no further information which was insufficient detail to pass this component."
- "It was very common for candidates to perform well in one section of the answer and poorly in the other, leading to an overall answer not meeting the requirements for a pass. For questions of this nature it is important to pay equal attention to each section as a poor mark in one section is very difficult to compensate for in the other section."
