question: 11
passRate: 86
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected that candidates would provide basic definitions, provide examples to support the definitions, and draw labelled graphs to demonstrating key points."
EC_extraCredit:
- "For the most part this basic pharmacology question was answered well, perhaps because it has been asked before. The examinerâ€™s comments at that time are still relevant. Most candidates were able to give passable definitions, draw correct log dose - response curves demonstrate key points, and correctly use opioids as examples."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Definitions were sometimes worded awkwardly or omitted. Some candidates linked efficacy with intrinsic activity, then neglected to explain either term. An opioid example of therapeutic index was rarely mentioned."
