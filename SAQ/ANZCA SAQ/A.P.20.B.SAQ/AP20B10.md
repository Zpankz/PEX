title: "Discuss the structure and function of the NMDA receptor and briefly describe the interaction of ketamine with this receptor"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2020
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 44
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The NMDA receptor is a voltage-sensitive ligand-gated receptor. There is some difference in detail between the recommended textbooks regarding sub-unit structure, so variations were accepted. Detail regarding the AMPA receptor in providing initial depolarization, the Mg2+ plug, glutamate and glycine binding, and ionic currents were necessary."
EC_extraCredit:
- "There were some good descriptions of where ketamine bound to NMDA, and the effect it had."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A number of candidates did not offer that one of the effects of ketamine was general anaesthesia."
- "There were a number of repeated errors that showed lack of general understanding. The NMDA is not a metabotropic (G-protein linked) receptor. Substance P and the NK-1 receptor are not involved in NMDA activation. The influx of Cl- ions is not excitatory."
- "Pharmacokinetic data for ketamine was neither asked for nor rewarded. Organ- based pharmacodynamic information for ketamine did not receive marks.."
- "Many candidates offered that the NMDA receptor caused long-term potentiation and various chronic pain phenomena, but very few attempted to describe a mechanism that related to NMDA activation and intracellular events."
