title: "Discuss respiratory system compliance and outline factors that affect it."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2020
sitting: B
question: 3
passRate: 91
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main domains assessed in this question were: • Definition of compliance in context of respiratory physiology • Composition of compliance of respiratory system – chest wall and lung • Different types of compliance – static and dynamic • Factors that increase and decrease: ▹ Chest wall compliance ▹ Lung compliance with appropriate explanation illustrating understanding of the topic"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra credit was given for: • Description of measurement method difference between static and dynamic compliances. • Explanation of hysteresis. • Correctly giving examples related to “slow” and “fast” alveoli and how they affect static and dynamic compliance. • Effect of anaesthesia on respiratory compliance."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common issues were: • Incorrect value and unit for respiratory compliance. • Compliance graphs (pressure-volume loop) were often used, but often incorrect. • Poor understanding of static/dynamic compliance and factors that affect them. • Factors affecting chest wall compliance were often missed. • Describing examples without indicating which direction they affect the compliance. • Misconception about relationship between some physiological/pathological state and the respiratory compliance (e.g. pregnancy, small airway disease)"
