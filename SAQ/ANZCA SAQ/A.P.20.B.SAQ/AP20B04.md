title: "Describe the physiological mechanisms by which the renal collecting duct is able to produce both dilute and concentrated urine."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2020
sitting: B
question: 4
passRate: 88
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The major domains assessed in this question were: • the mechanisms that result in presentation of a hypotonic filtrate to the collecting duct • the role of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in the collecting duct, including control mechanisms • the role of medullary tonicity in the movement of water"
- "Candidates who scored well addressed the 3 major domains being assessed and related each back to their role in formation of dilute and concentrated urine by the collecting duct."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Credit was given for other relevant correct material."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The most common problem was not considering the mechanisms involved in the two scenarios posed by the question – production of both a dilute and concentrated urine."
- "Other problems encountered included: • focussing on the formation and maintenance of the medullary solute gradient without relating it to the question • not understanding the role of ADH as the dominant mechanism for control of water movement in the collecting duct • not understanding how the production of ADH is controlled • the majority of diagrams did not add to the written answer"
