title: "a) Describe the immediate cardiovascular responses to the sudden loss of 30% of the blood volume in a healthy awake person b) How are these responses different if the patient is undergoing anaesthesia with sevoflurane?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2020
sitting: B
question: 1
passRate: 67
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The expected domains for this question were; • Context on degree of blood loss and its effect on volume status • A description of sympathetic nervous system responses • Other humoral/endocrine mediated responses. • Effects of sevoflurane on the cardiovascular system; application of this to a shocked state"
- "To pass, candidates were required to consider the context, describe autonomic nervous system mediated mechanisms, and describe how sevoflurane affects these responses."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The first section was generally well answered, with higher scores achieved with additional detail regarding humoral/endocrine changes, blood reservoir mobilisation and blood flow distribution."
- "Better answers gave an overview of sevoflurane’s effects on the cardiovascular system, especially the baroreceptor reflex, noting how sevoflurane would interfere with homeostatic responses to haemorrhage."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The second section had a much greater variation in the quality of answers. A significant portion of candidates provided just one or two brief notes resulting in at best a borderline pass mark overall."
