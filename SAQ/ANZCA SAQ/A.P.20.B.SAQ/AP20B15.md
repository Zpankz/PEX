title: "Discuss the pharmacokinetic implications of severe chronic kidney disease, using examples of drugs used in anaesthesia to illustrate your answer."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2020
sitting: B
question: 15
passRate: 41
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The focus of this question is on PK changes and required candidates to describe these changes as well as the implications."
- "Candidates were expected to give a reasonable explanation on at least distribution and elimination, with examples of commonly used drugs seen in anaesthesia."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better candidates recognised that CKD is on a spectrum with greater reductions in GFR with increasing severity, with end stage being GFR<15 mls/min, or dialysis dependent."
- "Better candidates considered the effects of dialysis in their answers (with effects on TBW and drug concentration), as well as multiorgan involvement (e.g hepatorenal syndrome)"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates attempted to define severe CKD and various GFR ranges were quoted."
- "The majority of answers were well structured with Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Elimination categories considered. For absorption, not many considered TBW changes resulting in oedema that may increase the barrier to diffusion and slow onset of patches or s/c drugs. Uraemia and its effects on gastric motility and nausea/vomiting, as well as GIT oedema may affect absorption of orally administered drugs."
- "Too often, there was not enough detail in the answer. Stating that clearance of a drug will be reduced with a decrease in GFR and will require dose adjustment is not sufficient at this level. The kidneys are responsible for eliminating drugs unchanged as well as metabolites of drugs that may also be active. A frequent example given of an active metabolite was morphine-6-glucoronide, but it also requires a brief mention of what the potential effects of this are and how to minimise this, by changes in dosing intervals or using alternative drugs for instance"
