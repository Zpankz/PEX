- "The best answers mentioned most or all of the possible adverse effects with a discussion of each."
- "This simply worded question highlighted a widespread pre-occupation with definitions and pre-defined structures falsely regarded as essential for a good mark."

- "Structures based on autonomic nervous system anatomy or receptor physiology appeared to distract individuals away from answering the question."
