title: "Outline the clinical laboratory assessment of liver function (46.4%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2017
sitting: A
question: 15
passRate: 46
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The crucial approach to this question is to explain the physiological basis of the laboratory tests."
- "A simple list of test names provides marks towards a pass but to reach a pass or score well a candidate had to demonstrate an understanding of the underlying physiology."
- "As an example of a good level of explanation when discussing coagulation disturbance many candidates mentioned INR but only a few went on to explain why it was the most sensitive test for coagulation in liver failure by relating it to the half life of the factors it tests."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common mistakes included “overviews” that could be lengthy and not relate to the question and so not add to the overall mark."
- "Also summaries of physiological functions of the liver that were not related to tests did not accrue marks."
- "Circular statements were another pitfall, where candidates rephrased their point as a way of explanation."
- "Describing other forms of assessment such as imaging or signs and symptoms gained no marks."
- "Tests of the haematological sequelae of liver failure were frequently omitted."
