title: "Draw both aortic root and a radial artery pressure wave forms on the same axes. Explain the differences between them (56.0%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2017
sitting: A
question: 10
passRate: 56
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Most candidates correctly drew arterial waveforms on appropriately labelled axes, as requested in the question."
- "Identification of the difference between the waveforms and elucidating the physics behind these differences were awarded marks."
EC_extraCredit:
- "the better candidates were able to accurately describe the causes of the changes in the individual features correctly."
- "Marks were also awarded for discussion of changes caused by aging or other pathological states if these were correctly related to the changes in the waveforms."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A large number of axes however were unlabelled, and had no values attached to them."
- "Candidates were not penalised if graphs were drawn on two identical axes rather than a single graph with superimposed waveforms."
