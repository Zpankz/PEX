entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2017
sitting: A
question: 4
passRate: 7
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A discussion of genetic variations should address the different phenotypes and prevalence in different populations."
- "Any accurate discussion of clinical relevance gained marks."
- "Relevant drugs that can be commented on include codeine, oxycodone, tramadol, methadone, beta-blockers, anti-emetics and tricyclic antidepressants."
- "Whether the enzyme metabolises drugs into active or inactive metabolites is important"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Discussion of ‘at risk’ groups such as children gained marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "a number of candidates incorrectly proposed that ultra-rapid metabolisers should be prescribed higher doses of codeine."
