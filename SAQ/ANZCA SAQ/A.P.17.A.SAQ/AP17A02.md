title: "Compare and contrast oxygen delivery via nasal cannulae (nasal prongs/specs), simple face mask (eg Hudson or CIG mask) and Venturi mask. (39.3%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2017
sitting: A
question: 2
passRate: 39
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This can be answered either in tabular form or under separate headings."
- "A good answer included most of the following: performance type (variable or fixed), oxygen reservoir, physical principle utilised, gas flow rates, range of FiO2 possible, risk of rebreathing, advantages/disadvantages and factors affecting performance."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better candidates demonstrated understanding of the relationship between peak inspiratory flow and FiO2 in each device, and the effect of ventilatory pattern."
- "Stating those conditions that favour higher FiO2 is a concise way to show such knowledge."
- "Additional marks were awarded for explaining the Bernoulli effect, Venturi effect and application of jet entrainment. A diagram of such often provided valuable clarification."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Extensive lists of advantages were not alone sufficient to pass."
