title: "A new test called the \"intubation score\" has a reported 90% sensitivity and 70% specificity when used to predict difficult intubation. Describe how this information and other statistics related to this test can be used in predicting difficult intubation. How will the incidence of difficult intubation affect the performance of this test? (53.0%)"

EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question was asked under section BT PO 1.2 of the learning outcomes."
- "It assessed a candidate’s understanding of the statistical utility and limitations of clinical tests that may be performed or ordered in clinical practice."
- "The question did not ask for physical features or high risk populations associated with difficult intubation."
- "Many candidates passed this question with correct definitions of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and incidence."
- "The addition of a correctly completed contingency table aided answers on how these values were calculated."
EC_extraCredit:
- "High scoring answers also included differences between incidence and prevalence and their impact on test results, likelihood ratios and receiver operator curves, as well other statistical terms such as Bayes’ theorem and Fagan nomogram."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates who used terms such as true positive (TP) instead of a, b, c and d were more likely to have an accurate contingency table."
