sitting: A
question: 7
passRate: 36
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Two key factors should have been considered with regard to a well-constructed answer to this question."
- "1. Drug factors such as protein binding, lipid solubility, molecular size, dose and concentration, intrinsic vasoconstrictor properties and adjuvants such as adrenaline, opioids and alpha-2-agonists. Metabolism of ester agents was also relevant."
- "2. Patient factors such as the site of administration, its vascularity and the structure of the nerve being blocked."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Higher marks were gained for discussions on pregnancy and the extremes of life."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This question was similar in structure to one asked in 2016 and many candidates failed due to incorrectly reading this question and answering the one of last year, or reading it correctly but failing to modify the structure they had developed to answer the one of last year."
