title: "Describe how the large daily volume of glomerular filtrate is altered by the kidney to form a relatively low volume of concentrated urine (29.2%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2017
sitting: A
question: 13
passRate: 29
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Key understanding points were: 1. Salt and water resorption must be separated for urinary concentration to occur 2. A hyperosmotic medullary interstitium is set up to allow ADH to titrate water resorption"
- "Key content points were: 1. A (very) brief overview of renal water handling 2. Establishment of a hyperosmotic medullary interstitium (loop of Henle, vasa recta and urea) 3. The action of ADH"
- "The role of ADH was generally well described, even in the poorer answers."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "It is worth noting that water handling in the proximal convoluted tubule is isosmotic and does not contribute to urinary concentration. It is thus of limited relevance to this question."
- "The countercurrent mechanism in the loop of Henle was variably described. Diagrams were frequently incorrect or confusing."
- "The role of the vasa recta was better explained."
- "Urea was frequently mentioned, but its role was rarely expanded upon."
- "Many candidates focused on points of limited or no relevance, eg regulation of renal blood flow, formation of glomerular filtrate (assumed in the question), resorption in the proximal convoluted tubule, tubuloglomerular feedback, glomerulotubular balance, total body water balance, blood volume regulation, solute resorption (including sodium, glucose and acid), role of ANP/angiotensin/aldosterone."
