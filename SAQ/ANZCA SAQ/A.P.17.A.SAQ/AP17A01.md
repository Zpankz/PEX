EC_expectedDomains:
- "The vessels expected were the internal jugular vein, the common carotid, and the internal and external carotids."
- "The relation between these structures throughout the neck was important, as well as their relation to the sternocleidomastoid."
- "Material required to pass this question can be found in any anatomy textbook coupled with mindful clinical practice."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates who clarified their diagrams with a brief note did better."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This question examined the anatomy of the major vessels in the neck relevant to central line placement and included several images: an ultrasound scan, a chest x-ray, and an outline diagram of the head, neck and upper thorax that the candidate was asked to complete."
- "The origin of the internal jugular vein was frequently imprecise. In a few diagrams it appeared to arise from somewhere near the occiput."
- "About 10% of candidates only drew the vessels in the immediate supraclavicular region, suggesting that the only way they knew to cannulate the internal jugular was via the low approach."
- "The terms \"internal carotid\" and \"common carotid\" were often used interchangeably, and diagrams often indicated a poor understanding of these vesselsâ€™ anatomy."
- "Identification of structures in the chest Xray was generally well done, although only 1/3 of candidates correctly defined where the tip of a central line catheter should ideally lie."
