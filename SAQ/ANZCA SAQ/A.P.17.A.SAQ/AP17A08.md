title: "Compare and contrast LMWH and unfractionated heparin (51.2%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2017
sitting: A
question: 8
passRate: 51
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Considerations in answering this question include dosing, monitoring, reversibility, effect of renal impairment and adverse effect profile."
- "Marks were available for descriptions of their mechanisms of action and pharmacokinetic profile."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better candidates mentioned timing implications with regard to neuraxial blockade; cost considerations; heparin resistance and the effect of high doses of UFH on platelet function."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Although most candidates were aware that LMWH principally acts via factor Xa and UFH via both Xa and IIa very few could explain why."
- "Many did not appreciate that all heparins act via inducing a conformational change in Antithrombin (AT)."
- "The inhibitory effect on thrombin requires the formation of a triple complex of AT/ heparin/ thrombin and this is only achieved with long chained heparins which are found predominantly in larger UFH preparations."
- "The different pharmacokinetic profiles were poorly described and understood. UFH is highly protein bound and subject to extensive metabolism by heparinases. At high doses this pathway is saturated and UFH exhibits zero order kinetics. LMWHs are less protein bound, have better bioavailability and predictable linear kinetics as they are principally eliminated renally."
