title: "Outline the physiological effects of the adrenal hormones aldosterone and cortisol. (Do NOT describe synthesis or metabolism) (65.5%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2017
sitting: A
question: 14
passRate: 65
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Marks were gained for a brief description of the mechanism of action of these steroid hormones, specifically that they act intracellularly on DNA transcription altering protein synthesis."
- "An outline of the effects of aldosterone required determining where in nephron it works, upon which cells, and which channels and pumps are involved in these actions."
- "It was not enough to only state that aldosterone causes reabsorption of Na (and H2O by osmosis) and secretion of K. The effect upon H secretion was also expected."
- "The effects of cortisol are widespread and candidates were NOT expected to cover them all to attain a pass mark, though better answers were rewarded for their breadth of understanding."
- "For example, many candidates correctly stated that cortisol stimulates catabolism. Better answers, however, would briefly elaborate to show that this provides amino acids which are then available for gluconeogenesis, and may also lead to muscle wasting...gaining several more marks in the process."
- "it was expected that metabolic actions (carbohydrate, protein, fat) and immune system effects would be well outlined."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better responses illustrated the numerous triggers for aldosterone release beyond just mentioning the renin-angiotensin system, and showed understanding of the triggers for renin release."
- "Comments on catecholamine responsiveness, fetal lung maturation, CNS effects were also rewarded, as was an illustration of the hypothalamic/pituitary axis, triggers for cortisol release and feedback mechanisms."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common errors included confusing aldosterone with ADH, and misunderstanding the terms catabolic and anabolic."
- "Numerous candidates spent time discussing the adrenal anatomy, or the adrenal medullary hormones, and marks were not given for this."
