EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question was best addressed with a systems-based approach."
- "Marks were given for discussion of the onset, duration and offset of these side effects."
- "Most candidates gave a description of the cardiovascular and respiratory consequences from sympathetic blockade, and effects at the thoracic, cervical and brainstem level."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Marks were also awarded for CNS effects such as about pupil changes, thermoregulation, and changes to airway reflexes."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Frequently omitted effects included the consequences of specific blockade of motor and sensory functions of cranial and peripheral nervous systems."
- "Discussion about management, systemic toxicity or other complications related to spinal anaesthesia did not score marks."
