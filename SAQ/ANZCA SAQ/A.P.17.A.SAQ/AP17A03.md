title: "Propofol and remifentanil TCI are often given together as a total intravenous anaesthesia technique. Discuss pharmacological reasons why this is a useful combination (47.0%)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2017
sitting: A
question: 3
passRate: 47
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question concerns core pharmacological concepts and techniques of practical importance in the provision of modern anaesthesia."
- "A good answer split the topic into four sections: pharmaceutics, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and, lastly, clinical applications of remifentanil and propofol TCI."
- "The question asked about the utility of the two drugs combined and this should be considered in an answer."
- "With regard to pharmaceutics, the only point of note is that remifentanil and propofol are compatible and do not precipitate."
- "Pharmacokinetics can be split into two parts; the general kinetics of the drugs (with an emphasis on synergism and onset and offset profile) and the advantages that a target controlled infusion might provide."
- "When discussing pharmacodynamics, some idea of clinically appropriate plasma and effect site concentrations and how remifentanil reduced that of propofol was valuable."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good answers acknowledged important side effects of each drug and discussed how the combination of these two drugs might minimise these."
- "Putting the pharmacological reasons into a clinical context such as airway surgery, avoiding a muscle relaxant, or malignant hyperthermia attracted additional marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Lists of pharmacokinetic values for half life, Keo, volume of distribution, pKa, ionised fractions etc without explaining their relevance did not attract marks."
