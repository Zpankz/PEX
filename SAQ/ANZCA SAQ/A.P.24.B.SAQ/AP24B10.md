title: "a) Define oral bioavailability (10% of marks) b) Describe the factors that influence oral bioavailability (80% of marks) c) Use one example to illustrate the clinical application of oral bioavailability (10% of marks)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2024
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 43
lo:
- "[[BT_GS 1.7]]"
- "[[BT_GS 1.8]]"
- "[[BT_GS 1.11]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "definition"
- "factors affecting oral bioavailability"
- "absorption from GIT"
- "first pass metabolism"
- "one clinical example (e.g. conversion between IV and oral doses of a specified drug)"
EC_extraCredit:
- "detail and nuance in answer, especially by including examples in part (b)"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "lack of detail in part (b) – note that the wording of the question is “describe” rather than “list”"
- "confusion about the effect of slow-release preparations – these do not usually decrease oral bioavailability because the AUC is the same"
- "excessive attention to GIT pathologies, at the expense of describing pharmacokinetic factors"
- "part (c) lacked a dose conversion between IV and oral preparations in many answers"
