entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2024
sitting: B
question: 02
passRate: 76
lo:
- "[[SS_OB 1.5]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "mechanism and consequences of IVC compression"
- "mechanism and consequences of aortic compression"
- "effects on both the mother and foetus (placenta) were expected"
EC_extraCredit:
- "understanding the effect of raised uterine venous pressure"
- "more anatomical detail – for example"
- "specifying the vertebral level at which aortic bifurcation occurs and how this relates to the fundal height at different stages of pregnancy"
- "recognising the implications of the IVC being located on the right of the aorta"
- "anatomy of the uterine arteries (they arise from the internal iliac arteries)"
- "understanding the function of the azygous venous system"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "there was wide variation in the gestational age at which aortocaval compression could occur – some candidates stated only in the third trimester, and this was flagged as a patient safety issue"
- "poor answers included general information on the physiological changes in pregnancy, rather than addressing the question that was asked"
