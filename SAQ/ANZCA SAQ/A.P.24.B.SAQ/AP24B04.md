title: "a) Describe the renal handling of glucose. b) Describe the physiological consequences of glycosuria."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2024
sitting: B
question: 04
passRate: 57
lo:
- "[[BT_PO 1.67]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "part (a)"
- "glucose is freely filtered at the glomerulus"
- "reabsorption occurs in the proximal tubules by secondary active transport (i.e. together with sodium, and against the concentration gradient for glucose) via luminal SGLT-2 transporters. The gradient for Na+ is generated by basolateral Na+/K+ pumps."
- "there is a transport maximum"
- "glucose leaves the cell via basolateral GLUT-2 transporters (facilitated diffusion)"
- "for part (b), the effects of an osmotic diuresis with loss of water and electrolytes, as well as loss of an energy substrate, were expected"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail about the transport mechanisms"
- "including a graph, to supplement the explanation"
- "understanding splay"
- "The introduction of SGLT-2 inhibitors into clinical practise has opened up additional scope for the answer to part (b). The physiological effects of glycosuria produced by SGLT-2 inhibitors include – BGL control in diabetes, diuresis to treat heart failure, and risk of ketoacidosis during fasting."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Part (b) was not well answered. Most candidates did not provide any detail about how an osmotic diuresis is caused by glucose – either in terms of the osmotic effect of glucose on tubular fluid volume, or the subsequent wash-out of the medullary concentration gradient and the consequences of this."
- "some candidates stated that glycosuria was involved in the normal physiological control of blood glucose; and others seemed to state that glycosuria could lead to hypoglycaemia"
