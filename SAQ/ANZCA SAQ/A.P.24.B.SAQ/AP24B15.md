- "[[BT_SQ 1.13]]"
- "[[BT_SQ 1.9]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "correctly drawn and labelled diagram"
- "scavenging is coupled to"
- "the manual APL valve on the bag limb"
- "the ventilator’s APL valve equivalent"
- "description of how active scavenging works"
- "low resistance tubing connects from both the manual and ventilator APL valves, to a reservoir chamber"
- "the reservoir is open at one end, so that no backpressure can build-up, and suction can entrain room air continually so that no negative pressure can be applied directly to the circuit"
- "suction is attached to the reservoir chamber"
- "scavenged gases are vented out the roof of the hospital"
- "safety valves prevent any positive or negative pressure developing within the scavenging system"
- "purpose of scavenging"
EC_extraCredit:
- "detail and breadth of answer"
- "diagrams to enhance the description of scavenging"
- "specifying the diameter of scavenging connections (different from circuit)"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many diagrams contained serious errors or omissions, reflecting poor understanding of the equipment used by anaesthetists daily."
- "Many diagrams were poorly labelled, or lacked any explanation."
- "Scavenging is coupled BOTH to the manual APL valve (which is on the bag limb), and to the ventilator’s APL valve equivalent. Fresh gas is being added CONTINUALLY to the circle breathing system, and this must have a means to escape. This is one of the functions of the APL valves. Scavenging is coupled to these to collect this waste gas, to prevent pollution of the operating theatre. Note that the manual APL valve has no function at all when the ventilator is in use."
- "By far the most common omission was the lack of scavenging from the back of the ventilator."
- "Scavenging systems are designed such that suction cannot be applied directly to the breathing system. This is why a reservoir chamber is required. Many candidates drew variations of scavenging arising directly from the inspiratory or expiratory limbs of the circle."
- "Some candidates claimed that scavenging enables recycling of volatile agents."
- "Some candidates claimed that waste gas is stored somewhere for transport away; or that gases are piped far away from the hospital for release."
- "Many answers overstated the occupational hazard posed by inhalational agents to clinical staff."
- "Scavenging has no role in minimising pollution of the earth’s atmosphere."
