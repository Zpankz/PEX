passRate: 42
lo:
- "[[BT_PO 1.115]]"
- "[[BT_RT 1.7]]"
- "[[BT_PO 1.116]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "understanding the ABO blood groups, with correct description and location of the antigens and antibodies"
- "understanding the basis of group-compatible FFP transfusions"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "the operational verb in this question is “explain”, which means to “make plain, interpret, or account for in detail” – many answers fell short of this level, as evidenced by the number of answers scoring a 2"
- "reproducing a compatibility table, without explanation, was not enough to pass"
- "confusion about the location of antigens and antibodies, or using these terms interchangeably"
- "discussing the Rhesus blood group"
- "A significant number of candidates had no understanding, or incorrect understanding, of the physiological basis of the ABO blood groups in relation to the compatibility of plasma. It is likely that these candidates had narrowly focused their study on the previously asked SAQ on O negative red cells, without properly understanding the whole topic of transfusion physiology. The implications for patient safety are obvious."
