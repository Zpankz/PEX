title: "These curves show plasma concentrations following the cessation of a 4 mcg/mL propofol target controlled infusion (TCI) after - a 1 hour infusion (blue dashed line) - a 5 hour infusion (red solid line) a) Explain the pharmacokinetics underlying the shape of these curves, with reference to the 25%, 50%, and 75% decrement times. b) Discuss the clinical application of these curves."

lo:
- "[[BT_GS 1.12]]"
- "[[BT_GS 1.59]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "mechanisms accounting for the shape of the graphs (multi-exponential), and the reasons why the 25% decrement times are very similar, but the 50% and 75% decrement times become progressively more different with a longer infusion"
- "distribution from plasma to peripheral tissues (considering fast and slow compartments, and the time taken for these compartments to equilibrate with plasma)"
- "re-distribution from tissues back to plasma, slowing further decline in plasma concentration"
- "metabolism and excretion"
- "clinical"
- "impact on time to recovery of consciousness (specifying the plasma concentration application – linking the decrement times with clinical anaesthesia at which this was expected to occur, and the corresponding decrement time)"
- "strategies to manage the lengthening decrement times in a longer anaesthetic"
- "in answering part (b), candidates were expected to draw on their clinical experience in formulating a discussion"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail"
- "showing understanding of the mathematical principles described by the expression C(p)t = Ae−αt + Be−βt + Ce−γt"
- "understanding the concept of rate constants"
- "patient variability (e.g. elderly); other drugs administered; Ce lags behind Cp (and Ce determines the CNS effect of propofol); TCI models are mathematically derived and may not accurately represent what is happening in vivo"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Not specifically addressing the different decrement times between the two graphs – this was the major focus of part (a)."
- "Confused or contradictory statements regarding the mechanisms for decline in plasma propofol concentration, and the relative importance of these mechanisms at different stages of the curves."
- "Using imprecise or vague language. The terms “clearance”, “elimination”, “distribution”, “redistribution”, “tri-exponential”, “first-order”, “half-life”, “half-time” were frequently used incorrectly."
- "Candidates frequently used equations or drew compartment models but failed to relate these to the question. No diagrams or equations were required to pass this question. Many candidates who included equations appeared to confuse terms or not understand what they represented."
- "Not understanding that the context sensitive half-time (CSHT) is the same thing as the 50% decrement time."
- "Some candidates wasted time discussing general principles of TCI models or propofol boluses when the question specifically asked about cessation of an infusion."
- "Many candidates spent very little time attempting to answer part (b). 50% of the marks were attributed to the clinical relevance of decrement times and so it was hard to pass the SAQ overall if this section had not been adequately addressed."
- "It was obvious that many candidates had pre-prepared responses for past questions on TCI models. These responses did not address the question that was asked."
