lo:
- "[[BT_RT 1.1]]"
- "[[BT_RT 1.2]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "shock classification with examples"
- "pathophysiology of septic shock"
- "triggered by bacterial exo- and endo-toxins (can also be due to other microbes)"
- "mediated by an exaggerated host immune response"
- "vasodilation (with ↓SVR) and capillary leak (with hypovolaemia) were the bare minimum mechanisms of hypotension expected in the answer"
- "there can be hypotension with increased cardiac output at least initially – however, despite the ↑CO, there is inadequate organ perfusion"
EC_extraCredit:
- "part (a) – acknowledging overlap between the types of shock"
- "detail about bacterial endotoxins"
- "detail about mediators and their specific effects"
- "explaining the mechanism of inadequate organ perfusion in the setting of hypotension, despite an increased cardiac output"
- "including more detail about CVS effects, such as myocardial dysfunction"
- "including mechanisms of other system effects, such as DIC, AKI, multi-organ failure"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "part (a) – omitting hypovolaemia as one of the shock classifications; or including some of the classifications of hypoxia (such as histotoxic) within the shock classification"
- "an alarming number of candidates did not mention BP/MAP at all in part (b) and only a minority properly understood the alterations in cardiovascular physiology seen in septic shock"
- "uncertainty about how changes in SVR typically affect BP and CO"
- "confusion about the effects of arterial vs. venous dilation"
- "including compensatory responses despite being instructed not to – no marks were awarded for this information"
- "some candidates focused on anaerobic metabolism, and gave scant (or no) attention to the circulation"
- "writing a lot of detail about cytokines or inflammatory mediators, at the expense of covering the cardiovascular physiology"
