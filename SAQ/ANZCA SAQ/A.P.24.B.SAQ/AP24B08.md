title: "Describe the individual effects of propofol and sevoflurane on the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) and cerebral blood flow (CBF)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2024
sitting: B
question: 08
passRate: 46
lo:
- "[[BT_GS 1.24]]"
- "[[BT_GS 1.31]]"
- "[[BT_GS 1.48]]"
- "[[BT_RT 1.13]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "the dose-dependent effect of propofol on CMRO2 and CBF"
- "especially the direct relationship without uncoupling"
- "the dose-dependent effect of sevoflurane on CMRO2 and CBF"
- "especially the triphasic association"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail"
- "quantifying the dose related effects"
- "effect on CO2 responsiveness"
- "linking the changes in cerebral blood volume to ICP"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "some candidates stated that sevoflurane is contraindicated in neurosurgery – this is completely untrue"
- "confusion between cerebral vascular resistance, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral blood volume"
- "confusion between myogenic and metabolic autoregulation"
- "claiming that the decrease in CBF associated with propofol is due to its systemic circulatory effects causing hypotension (this was also commented on in the 2021.1 exam report – this error has significant implications for patient safety)"
- "no mention of the mechanisms of the effect of propofol and sevoflurane on CMRO2 and CBF"
- "including graphs which contradicted the written text and/or graphs with unlabelled axes"
- "some candidates discussed the intracranial elastance curve in complete isolation from the question that was asked"
- "This topic is comprehensively covered in Miller 9th edition, Chapter 11."
