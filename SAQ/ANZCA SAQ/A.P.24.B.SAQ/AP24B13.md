EC_expectedDomains:
- "gentamicin mechanism of action, and spectrum of activity"
- "why given once-daily"
- "toxicity (especially nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity)"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail within the above domains"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "although many candidates stated that gentamicin binds to the “30S ribosomal sub-unit”, most failed to link this with impaired protein synthesis as the mechanism of bactericidal activity"
- "the spectrum of activity was often poorly described, or incorrect (e.g. “broad spectrum”, or having activity against anaerobes)"
- "most candidates recognised that once-daily dosing is made possible by the post-antibiotic effect (despite the short half-life of gentamicin); however few answers addressed the balance between concentration dependent killing, and the desire for reducing toxicity by limiting exposure of the patient to high plasma concentrations"
- "very few candidates noted that the principal ototoxicity with gentamicin is vestibular rather than auditory"
