title: "Explain how the transfer of oxygen between alveoli and pulmonary capillaries may become diffusion limited."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2024
sitting: B
question: 01
passRate: 55
lo:
- "[[BT_PO 1.24]]"
- "[[BT_RT 1.25]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "understanding the factors which influence diffusion, with specific reference to oxygen"
- "effect of pathology"
- "effect of altitude (i.e. atmospheric pressure)"
- "effect of exercise (i.e. faster capillary transit time)"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail about each of the above, including numerical values"
- "understanding the combined effect of the above"
- "understanding the impact of the reaction time of O2 combining with haemoglobin"
- "including graphs to enhance the explanation (West 11th ed, Fig 3.3 A and B)"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "incorrect Fick equation"
- "including information that was not asked for in the question (e.g. diffusion of CO2 and carbon monoxide; or the measurement of diffusion limitation)"
- "lack of explanation as to how pathologies cause diffusion limitation"
- "poorly drawn or inaccurate diagrams"
