title: "Outline the mechanisms by which each of the following drugs cause vasodilation - i. glyceryl trinitrate - ii. magnesium - iii. clonidine - iv. phentolamine - v. milrinone"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2024
sitting: B
question: 14
passRate: 42
lo:
- "[[BT_PO 1.58]]"
- "[[BT_PO 1.60]]"
- "[[BT_PO 1.54]]"
- "[[BT_PO 1.98b]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "mechanism by which each of the specified drugs causes vasodilation"
- "candidates who understood smooth muscle physiology were better able to describe the mechanisms"
EC_extraCredit:
- "detail"
- "breadth of answer, covering all 5 drugs"
- "understanding different vascular sites of action where relevant"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "only writing the drug class (e.g. “phentolamine is an alpha blocker”) was not regarded as an adequate description of mechanism of action"
- "no marks were awarded for drug mechanisms other than vasodilation"
- "incorrect drug-receptor interactions were common errors, especially for clonidine"
- "incorrect source of nitric oxide from GTN"
- "vague mechanisms for magnesium"
- "incorrect or no mention of the final steps that result in vascular smooth muscle relaxation with each drug"
