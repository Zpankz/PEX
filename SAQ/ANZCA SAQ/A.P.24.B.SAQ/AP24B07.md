title: "Describe the effects of perioperative hypothermia, at a core temperature of 34°C, using the following headings - compensatory responses (10% of marks) - body system effects (80% of marks) - pharmacological effects (10% of marks) (Do not discuss mechanisms of heat loss)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2024
sitting: B
question: 07
passRate: 49
lo:
- "[[BT_GS 1.66]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "the whole question was very clearly based around a core temperature of 34°C"
- "compensatory responses (especially postoperative shivering and vasoconstriction)"
- "body system effects"
- "coagulation, immune, neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, other"
- "pharmacological effects (especially drug metabolism)"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail, breadth, and clinical nuance"
- "understanding that the increased cardiac output and increased myocardial oxygen demand mainly occur postoperatively due to shivering – this can cause myocardial ischaemia in some patients"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This question was last asked in 2021.2. It was re-worded on this occasion to be more structured and more narrowly focused, to try to avoid the misunderstandings seen previously."
- "focusing lots of time on part (a) despite this being allocated only 10% of the marks"
- "writing generic information about thermoregulation and mechanisms of heat loss, despite being instructed not to do this – no marks were awarded for this information"
- "describing the effects of deep hypothermia (e.g. 18°C), or mixing up both mild and deep hypothermia, despite the question specifying 34°C"
- "omitting coagulopathy"
- "inconsistencies within the answer, such as describing increased sympathetic tone, but then describing end-organ effects which contradicted this"
- "vague information about pharmacological effects"
