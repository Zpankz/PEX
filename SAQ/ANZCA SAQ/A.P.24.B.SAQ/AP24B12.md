title: "a) Explain the mechanism of action of neostigmine for reversal of neuromuscular blockade. b) Discuss how the depth of neuromuscular block influences the clinical use of neostigmine."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2024
sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 40
lo:
- "[[BT_GS 1.39]]"
- "[[BT_GS 1.55]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "mechanism of neostigmine"
- "chemical interaction between neostigmine, and the ionic and esteratic binding sites on acetylcholinesterase (AChE)"
- "how the acetylcholine (ACh) concentration in the synaptic cleft is thereby increased"
- "understanding that ACh is the agonist which competes with the non-depolarising NMBD"
- "clinical"
- "understanding the ceiling effect"
- "understanding the minimum TOF count required for reversal"
- "correct dose(s) and expected time needed for reversal in relation to the depth of block"
EC_extraCredit:
- "more detail about the neostigmine-AChE interaction, especially in relation to carbamylation; and showing understanding of the structure-activity relationship of neostigmine"
- "more detail and nuance regarding clinical use, for example – dose variations for different levels of block; potential to cause weakness if given when TOFR > 0.9; expected onset times and mechanism of this use of neostigmine"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "incorrect (or no mention of) safe minimum TOF counts for reversal"
- "incorrect doses or dose ranges"
- "wrong explanation of the ceiling effect (often using examples implying that non-depolarising NMBDs are non-competitive)"
- "describing neostigmine as an “anticholinesterase inhibitor”"
- "referring to pseudo(plasma)cholinesterase throughout the answer"
- "comparing and contrasting neostigmine and sugammadex"
- "describing muscarinic side effects and their prevention"
- "not allocating equal time for both parts of the question"
