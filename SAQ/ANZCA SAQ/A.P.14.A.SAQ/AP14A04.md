title: "Describe the physiological basis of methods used to prevent hypoxaemia prior to intubation in a rapid sequence induction. Include any adverse effects of these methods."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2014
sitting: A
question: 04
passRate: 16
EC_expectedDomains:
- "In order to pass this question it was necessary to demonstrate that hypoxaemia is avoided by increasing oxygen stores and maintaining them. This mandated a discussion on the role of FRC as an oxygen store, and preoxygenation as a means of augmenting that store."
- "To achieve a pass, it was also necessary to provide some description on the role of positioning, and also that of apnoeic oxygenation."
- "A discussion on the complications of all these modalities was also asked for, but frequently omitted."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers demonstrated this using the alveolar gas equation."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most low scoring answers included a huge amount of irrelevant information, often extending for several pages. Examples which attracted no marks included: • the role of blood transfusion • cricoid pressure (commonly discussed) • the role of video laryngoscopy • side effects of suxamethonium (commonly discussed) • the cost of sugammadex • the role of chest physiotherapy on the ward • detailed spirometery diagrams"
- "Several candidates also asserted that preoxygenation causes diffusion hypoxia."
- "Candidates are also reminded that rephrasing a point already made attracts no extra marks."
