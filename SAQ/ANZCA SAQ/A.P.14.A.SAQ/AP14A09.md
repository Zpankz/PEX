title: "Describe the washout of sevoflurane from a patient following two hours of general anaesthesia. You may wish to use a graph to illustrate the description."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2014
sitting: A
question: 09
passRate: 35
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To achieve a pass, the following were required: • a clear explanation of the elimination kinetics of sevoflurane with due consideration to a time course appropriate to the termination of anaesthesia after two hours. • A washout graph including appropriate axis labelling, a multi exponential decay curve, time course and half times consistent with volatile washout. • a description of the movement of sevoflurane out of the alveolus, from plasma to alveolus, from the various compartments to plasma and their respective time courses • a description of factors which underpin those kinetics, including depth and duration of anaesthesia, alveolar ventilation and fresh gas flows, compartmental blood flows and solubilities."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for: • identifying differences in the kinetics of uptake versus elimination, describing the impact of cardiac output, an explanation of the clinical relevance of elimination kinetics"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates seemed to have difficulty describing the washout or elimination phase of volatile anaesthesia and endeavoured to instead describe the kinetics of induction or uptake. Although there are many principles shared by the two phases, generally such an approach generated a muddled answer which could not score well."
- "Common errors included • providing irrelevant information - the chemical structure of sevoflurane , kinetic data tables without understanding, wash-in graphs, detailed discussions of Fick's law, detailed algebraic manipulations • confused graphs - nonsensical labelling - (FA/FI, FI/FA), graphing wash-in and out on the same axes, incorrect decrement rate • confusion with respect to the terms fresh gas flow and FiO2 • lack of understanding of compartmental modelling and associated kinetics"
