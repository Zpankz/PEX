EC_errorsCommon:
- "Commonly confused issues included: Cognitive decline makes it more difficult for patients to communicate that they are in pain. It does not mean that they do not perceive pain."
- "Most candidates did not clearly distinguish or even discuss the difference between normal ageing and the effects of disease. Alzheimer’s disease and Lewy bodies are not part of the normal ageing process."
- "Autonomic nervous system changes were poorly understood—noradrenaline levels rise with age, but the response to beta stimulation decreases."
- "Candidates often used afferent to mean effferent and vice versa."
