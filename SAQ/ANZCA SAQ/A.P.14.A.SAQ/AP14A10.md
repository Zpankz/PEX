title: "List the pharmacodynamic differences between tramadol and morphine."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2014
sitting: A
question: 10
passRate: 73
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Major points expected for a pass included that tramadol was a racaemic mixture with actions as a partial mu agonist, as well as a noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake inhibitor."
- "Under the CNS effects, candidates should note that there is a ceiling effect to tramadol, as opposed to morphine, and hence its side effects of sedation, central respiratory depression are limited."
- "Parasympathetic stimulation leads to bradycardia, with morphine, compared with the increased sympathetic tone seen with tramadol."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Bonus marks were given for mention of urinary retention with morphine, histamine release effects with morphine, but not tramadol, and drug interactions between tramadol and MAOI, SSRIs."
- "Although evidence is limited, marks were given for stating that there may be increased awareness using tramadol is part of general anaesthetic and that ondansetron may increase tramadol requirements."
- "Tramadol has a role in neuropathic pain."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates often mentioned the difference in potencies of the two drugs without emphasizing that tramadol had lower efficacy i.e. the ceiling effect of its analgesia."
- "Few mentioned that most of the action of tramadol is due to an active metabolite, which has much higher affinity to the mu receptor than the parent compound."
- "Others wrongly said that tramadol is a synthetic codeine derivative and that it had actions on the NMDA receptor."
- "Some candidates mentioned that meiosis (cell division) occurred more with morphine, when the intention was probably miosis. (pupillary constriction)"
