entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2014
sitting: A
question: 15
passRate: 40
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Main Points expected for a pass: • removal of the placenta and consequences of this. • reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance. • increase in systemic vascular resistance. • closure of ductus venosus, foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus. • discussion of the mechanisms for these changes."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional points could be gained for: • time scales of changes. • cellular mechanisms of changes. • clinical significance. • noting that these changes are reversible for varying amounts of time."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common problems: • illegible handwriting • poor layout and structure and evidence of poor time management • too much time spent on outlining normal fetal circulation. • time wasted drawing diagrams. • confusion as to where shunts were located and the role of prostaglandins. • the main reason for failing this question was insufficient core knowledge"
