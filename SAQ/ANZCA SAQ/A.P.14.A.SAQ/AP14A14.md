EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question required candidates to explain the differences in energy substrates and fluid balance during fasting over periods commonly encountered in clinical practice."
- "The question specified a fast of fluids and food for a healthy adult."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The question lends itself to answering quickly in a table format, but many answers were in prose of varying quality."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some candidates did not interpret the question correctly, and attempted to discuss only fluid balance issues or food issues."
- "Some candidates discussed fasting implications over longer periods or, more commonly, for pathological conditions such as diabetes, or even for children."
- "Many candidates demonstrated a misunderstanding of fluid balance and energy substrates within the two timeframes."
- "Many candidates did not appreciate the fluid loss in 6 hours amounted to approximately 1%"
