EC_expectedDomains:
- "To achieve a pass, candidates should have explained: • Why calibrated and accurate vaporizers are required to safely deliver different volatile anaesthetics to patients. • A definition of plenum vaporizers and brief description of their method of function, both variable bypass and injection types. Diagrams commonly contained useful information that picked up marks. • Methods for ensuring that the correct volatile anaesthetic is delivered from the correct vaporizer. • Why temperature compensation is required and how it is achieved • The role that mounting systems play in vaporizer safety."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Bonus marks were awarded for tipping and transport safety, methods of avoiding the pumping effect, MRI compatibility, electronic alarms in desflurane vaporisers and sources of leaks and how they may be avoided."
EC_errorsCommon:
