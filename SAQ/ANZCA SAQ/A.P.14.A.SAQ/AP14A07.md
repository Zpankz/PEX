title: "Describe the local anatomy relevant to the performance of a lumbar epidural block."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2014
sitting: A
question: 07
passRate: 61
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A labelled diagram would adequately show most of what was asked for in the question. This diagram especially from a lateral view schematically showing the structures or ‘layers’ from skin to the space after penetrating the ligamentum flavum was completed by most candidates."
- "The content of the epidural space which surrounds the dural sac and the cauda equina has important structures in it. Damage to any of these has significant sequelae."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The vascular structures being placed generally situated in the space anterolateraly was noted in many good answers."
- "The mention of extra useful anatomical variations such as venous congestion during pregnancy and labour, increased fatty tissue in the obese, and origin of the arterial supply, the destination of the venous drainage, the presence of a lymphatic drainage all indicated a good understanding of the anatomy of the epidural space."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The ligamentum flavum is attached on the anterior aspects of the laminae of the vertebrae and is not a continuous layer as such"
- "There was some confusion between the anterior superior iliac spines, the intercrestal line and the posterior superior iliac spine deciding the site of placement."
- "The technique and the description of the methodology of performing the epidural was not asked for and even if correctly outlined did not attract marks."
