title: "Describe the factors affecting the diffusion of gas at the placenta, including the Bohr and Haldane effects"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2012
sitting: A
question: 13
passRate: 50
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Main Points expected for a pass:"
- "which gases were transferred at the placenta with normal values for the mother and foetus"
- "how gases diffuse across the placenta with relevance to Fickâ€™s law of diffusion and how the placenta differs to the lung"
- "detailed descriptions of the Bohr and Haldane effects"
- "explanation of the double Bohr and double Haldane effects as they occur at the placenta"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional points could be gained for:"
- "maternal hyperventilation with mechanisms"
- "placental oxygen consumption"
- "quantification of the effect of Bohr and Haldane effects"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates had a structure to their answers, in some cases suggesting poor time management."
- "In many answers there was confusion regarding the direction of shifts in the haemoglobin oxygen disocciation curve."
- "Few candidates mentioned the values of CO2/O2 at the placenta, and of those that did many were incorrect."
- "The main reason for failing this question was insufficient core knowledge"
