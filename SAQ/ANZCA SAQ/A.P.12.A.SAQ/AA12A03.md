entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2012
sitting: A
question: 03
passRate: 54
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question had to be interpreted precisely. Candidates had to outline the groups of drugs which reduced volume and acidity, and then concentrate on their mechanism of effect."
- "A more complete categorization of the drugs included antacids (both particulate and non-particulate), H2 antagonists, protein pump inhibitors, prostaglandin antagonists, muscarinic antagonists, prokinetic agents, emetic drugs and endocrine analogues."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Those who described or illustrated mechanisms of action in greater detail and included discussion regarding intermediate messengers attracted more marks."
- "Additional statements relating to individual drug groups about magnitude of effect on gastric volume and acid secretion also attracted marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Discussions of side effects did not attract marks."
- "Dividing the page into columns appeared to help in many instances."
