title: "List the side effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Briefly explain the mechanisms responsible for each of these side effects."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2012
sitting: A
question: 06
passRate: 32
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Main Points expected for a Pass:"
- "A list generated that included at least the 3 main categories of side effects – renal, platelet & gastric."
- "Each side-effect to have the mechanism specific for the effect, described in some detail, particularly the prostaglandins involved & the implications ?"
- "Gastric side-effects described in terms of inflammation, ulceration, perforation from ulceration & potential for gastric bleeding."
- "mechanism for gastric effects related to inhibition from protective effects of prostaglandins PGI2 & PGE2"
- "renal side effects related to reduced renal blood flow and regulation and reduced GFR"
- "mechanism for renal effects related to loss of prostacyclin mediated vasodilation"
- "Platelet effects described as inhibition of aggregation related to prevention of action of thromboxane A2. Bleeding & bruising to be mentioned."
- "Precipitation of bronchospasm should have been included to achieve a good pass. The mechanism being shunting of PG metabolism to produce higher concentrations of leukotrienes."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional Points which attracted higher marks:"
- "effect on the patency of the ductus arteriosus in neonates"
- "COX 2 inhibitors having a pro-thrombotic effect due to ratio of thromboxane to prostacyclin inhibition"
- "COX 2 inhibitors effect on myocardial infarction and stroke."
- "worsening of renal side effects in particular patient populations such as hypovolaemia, CCF or liver disease."
- "NSAID effects on uterine tone"
- "allergic effects such as Steven-Johnson syndrome"
- "Inhibition of bone healing/repair."
- "Reye’s syndrome with aspirin use in children"
- "toxic effects of aspirin on acid/base balance"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common Mistakes:"
- "large amount of irrelevant or non-specific information about PGss in general, particularly pages dedicated to the prostaglandin synthesis pathways"
- "no list generated"
- "oo specific mechanisms described, with very limited details about the prostaglandins involved, or how their inhibition related to clinical effects."
- "some answers very short & incomplete, but no actual blank books"
