title: "In relation to the pharmacokinetics of nitrous oxide, describe the significance of partition coefficients, increasing inspired concentration, the second gas effect and diffusion hypoxia."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2012
sitting: A
question: 02
passRate: 68
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question asked candidates to address four fundamental concepts in the pharmacokinetics of nitrous oxide. Candidates should allocate appropriate time for each of these issues."
- "Partition coefficient: Most candidates were able to point out that blood/gas partition coefficient of nitrous oxide is low (exact value is not required), but few have clearly elaborated on the significance of this value (such as rapid equilibration)."
- "Increasing inspired concentration: Candidates should note that “concentrating effect” is not the only phenomenon that occurs with increasing inspired concentration of nitrous oxide, the other effects such as increased inspiratory ventilation and offsetting of low uptake should also be mentioned."
- "Diffusion hypoxia: Most candidates were able to explain the concept of diffusion hypoxia as the dilution of alveolar oxygen by nitrous oxide after cessation of delivery. A better answer should also include potential hypoventilation as alveolar carbon dioxide is also diluted."
EC_extraCredit: []
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common errors and omissions included:"
- "Second gas effect: It is somewhat surprising that a substantial proportion of candidates have mistaken the concept of second gas effect as the additive (or synergistic) effect of combining inhalational agents."
