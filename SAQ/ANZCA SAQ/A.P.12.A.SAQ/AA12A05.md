title: "Using opioids as examples describe and illustrate with graphs what you understand by the terms \"potency\", \"efficacy\", \"partial agonist\", \"competitive antagonist\", and \"therapeutic index\"."

EC_expectedDomains:
- "Potency is the relative dose required for a given effect. It largely determines the dose administered. It is best illustrated with log dose – response curves. Examples of opioids drawn according to the relative potency were expected."
- "Efficacy is the maximal effect able to be achieved by the drug regardless of dose. It is used to compare the drug’s ability to elicit a full or partial biological response."
- "A partial agonist is a drug whose maximum effect is less than a full agonist, e.g. buprenorphine vs. morphine."
- "Competitive antagonists are drugs which compete at the same receptor to reverse the effect of an agonist, e.g. naloxone and morphine. This can be overcome by increasing the agonist concentration."
- "Therapeutic index is based on quantal dose response curves. It is the lethal dose in 50% of population divided by the effective dose in 50% of the population. This type of data is available only in animal studies. Human studies are limited and toxic dose is used instead of lethal dose, e.g. respiratory depression vs analgesia for opioids. It is not the therapeutic range."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were given for clear descriptions about ED50, and distinguishing between potency and affinity."
- "Bonus marks for discussing why this occurs."
- "Bonus marks were awarded to those who distinguished it from non-competitive antagonism."
- "Extra marks were awarded for discussing the limitations of therapeutic index."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common omissions were failure to discuss all five concepts or failure to use appropriately labelled graphs or opioids as examples."
