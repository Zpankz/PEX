title: "Describe the factors involved in the balance between left ventricular myocardial oxygen supply and demand"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2012
sitting: A
question: 16
passRate: 54
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question had two, inter-related, parts: supply and demand."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers discussed the points of conflict, particularly that increased heart rate both increases demand and decreases supply; the role of high extraction; and that the clinical determinants of cardiac output: heart rate, preload, afterload, and contractility are a good way to discuss demand."
- "While, the Hagenâ€“Poiseuille equation for flow is useful, better answers acknowledged that radius to the power of 4 is the dominant factor and then the factors that change radius."
- "Further, better answers described both the flow and oxygen content components of oxygen supply and clearly described the role of systole and diastole."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates are reminded that this examination is syllabus based questions, with the required information being obtained from the listed reference texts. Exam marking schemes are based on these reference texts. The reading list of reference texts is regularly reviewed, and assessed for their relevance to the basic sciences in anaesthesia. Non-recommended sources of information may be inaccurate."
