entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2012
sitting: A
question: 09
passRate: 63
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Better answers included an accurate description of high and low pressure baroreceptors with accurate anatomical locations of the receptors, an outline of their role as stretch receptors in a negative feedback system designed to maintain systemic arterial pressure, and a concise discussion of the components of the feedback loop, with clear descriptions of the afferent and efferent pathways involved and effector mechanisms."
EC_extraCredit: []
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Poor answers failed to demonstrate an understanding of the integrated nature of the feedback systems involved, omitted expected details of relevant neural pathways, and excluded descriptions of both high and low pressure baroreceptors."
