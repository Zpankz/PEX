title: "Discuss factors influencing the recovery and reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2012
sitting: A
question: 04
passRate: 38
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates needed to show an understanding of the pharmacokinetics of rocuronium and how alteration of pharmacokinetic variables influence offset of action."
- "A thorough knowledge of the drugs which interfere with rocuronium induced neuromuscular blockade was required."
- "Successful candidates not only stated the drugs but also explained how they affected neuromuscular transmission at a pre or post synaptic level."
- "Successful candidates also included physiological variables which affect reversal from neuromuscular blockade including hypothermia, acidosis and hypokalaemia."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Marks were also awarded for discussing alterations in pharmacokinetics due to age, obesity and pregnancy."
- "Successful candidates also included physiological variables which affect reversal from neuromuscular blockade including hypothermia, acidosis and hypokalaemia."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The factors influencing the recovery from neuromuscular blockade are dependent not only on drug pharmacokinetics but also on the state of the neuromuscular junction."
- "Simply listing a pharmacokinetic variable without explaining how it affects duration of neuromuscular blockade did not gain marks."
- "Many candidates omitted to state that giving repeat doses or drug infusions would affect recovery from rocuronium."
- "Recovery from neuromuscular blockade also depends on pharmacodynamic factors such as changes in receptor numbers or sensitivity as occurs in myasthenia gravis and burns patients."
- "Although reversal agents influence the recovery of neuromuscular blockade, this question was not about reversal agents. Marks were not gained for in depth discussion about the various anticholinesterases and cyclodextrin."
