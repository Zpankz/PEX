EC_expectedDomains:
- "To answer this question candidates needed both to know factual material and to be able apply it in a discussion on ketamine's suitability or otherwise as an intravenous agent."
- "Breadth is also needed in this question with pharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics addressed in addition to pharmacodynamics."
- "Ketamine is used for both induction and maintenance of anaesthesia, with maintenance being usually with bolus dosing, and a pharmacokinetic discussion needs to explain this."
EC_extraCredit: []
EC_errorsCommon:
- "It was difficult for candidates who used a table to actually discuss the points, and separating advantages and disadvantages made it difficult to explain the balance between them."
- "For example, consider the best structure to expound that the maintenance of airway reflexes is advantageous when under resourced but that this needs to be considered against the risk of airway irritability with airway placement or with the increased oral secretions seen with ketamine."
- "Many candidates wrote about alternate routes of ketamine administration or its use in chronic pain, neither of which garnered marks."
- "A previous year's question compared ketamine to propofol and some candidates appeared to answer this, not the current question."
