title: "Describe the effects of resonance and damping on an invasive arterial blood pressure tracing."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2013
sitting: B
question: 08
passRate: 30
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A brief description of an invasive arterial blood pressure measurement system followed by a definition of resonance and a definition of damping allowed for better structuring of answers."
- "What was required after that was a slightly more detailed description of why resonance could be an issue and how it is engineered out of the measurement system."
- "A discussion of the range of values for damping that could apply to a system and what those values mean, followed by an appreciation of critical and optimal damping would round out a good answer."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers demonstrated a methodical approach to the question, had accurate drawings and were factually correct."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The most common reason for not passing this question was simply being too brief and not including enough of the elements that were expected in an answer to this question."
- "Repetition of material was present in many answers but was not rewarded with additional credit."
- "More than a few answers confused critical and optimal damping with the range of values given for optimal damping falling between 0.33 and 0.8."
