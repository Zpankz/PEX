title: "Discuss the physiological significance of the blood-brain barrier."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2013
sitting: B
question: 04
passRate: 38
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to include a definition of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and the micro-anatomical features, unique to its function."
- "The control of ion passage, along with which substances could freely pass and those which cannot was expected."
- "Description of how the area postrema lies outside the BBB and the role in emesis was considered to be basic knowledge"
- "Most candidates correctly identified the role of the BBB in neuronal homeostasis, and the protective function against pathogens and toxins."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers included other circumventricular organs and their role."
- "Better answers included a barrier function separating central neurotransmitters from the periphery and vice versa, including descriptions of enzyme systems."
- "The role of carbon dioxide in altering CSF pH, with ensuing stimulation of the respiratory centre was generally well understood when described."
- "Better answers also included situations of altered function of the BBB (neonate, meningitis, profound hypertension etc)."
- "When describing particular properties of the BBB, examples of drugs (in particular those commonly used in anaesthesia) relating to those properties was useful."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates incorrectly believed gap junctions to be present."
- "Knowledge of neuroanatomy, and location of various physiological control centres within the brain was generally poor when specified in answers."
- "There was a wide variation in answers as to which ions were able to pass the blood brain barrier and which were not."
- "Most candidates correctly identified the impermeability to proteins."
- "Many candidates discussed Fickâ€™s law of diffusion. Very few candidates were able to correctly interpret how it applied to the selective permeability of the BBB."
- "Many candidates also described the Monro-Kellie doctrine relating to intracranial pressure, which was not considered relevant to the actual question."
