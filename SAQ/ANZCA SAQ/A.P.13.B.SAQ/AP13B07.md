sitting: B
question: 07
passRate: 38
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Good answers were well organized with a concise introductory heading followed by classification into metabolic, immunological, haematological, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, foetal, vascular and permissive effects."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Some good answers included a description of mechanism of action of cortisol at the molecular level, which gained extra marks."
- "Similarly, candidates who were able to explain why cortisol is a “stress hormone” and what benefits it confer to the individual scored extra marks."
- "A few well-written answers also included a discussion of how cortisol exerts its anti-inflammatory effects."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates mentioned osteoporosis as a physiologic effect when in fact it occurs only in conditions of excess glucocorticoids over long periods."
- "Irrelevant to the question are: Circadian nature of ACTH secretion, which is the cause of confusion to many candidates. (Cortisol is NOT the hormone responsible for normal sleep-awake cycle); Regulatory control of cortisol and the negative feedback loop. (However, marks were awarded to candidates who mentioned that glucocorticoids inhibit ACTH secretion); A system-based description of Cushing syndrome, which is a pathological state; Steroid supplementation during surgery."
- "The main cause for failing this question was insufficient detail demonstrating a lack of knowledge and poor understanding."
