EC_expectedDomains:
- "The answer to this question primarily required an understanding of the physical properties of the different volatile agents and thus the safety requirements of delivery system for these anaesthetic agents."
- "A definition of a plenum vaporiser would have assisted most candidates."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Bonus marks were awarded for information on back pressure relief valves placed downstream of vaporisers, details of desflurane vaporizer safety, MRI safety, tipping and vaporiser leaks."
- "Marks were awarded for highlighting that vaporisers are agent specific and that as a result filling systems have been developed to eliminate filling with incorrect agents; a discussion of temperature compensation to ensure reliable volatile delivery and outlining mounting systems."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates were confused about the position of a plenum vaporiser. They are placed outside the breathing circuit."
