EC_expectedDomains:
- "To score good marks it was necessary to describe in some detail the handling of water by the kidney at the various points along the nephron."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The highest scoring answers were able to concentrate on water and the kidney, while not getting distracted by concepts such as baroreceptors, and the role of the autonomic nervous system."
- "Curiously however, even the lowest scoring answers usually clearly and correctly described the role of V2 receptors and aquaporin channels in the collecting duct."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "There was significant variation across candidates in interpretation of the question."
- "Long introductory paragraphs were frequent but almost never constructive in terms of gaining marks, and only served to waste valuable time."
- "Similarly, there is no point in duplicating information contained in a diagram with text and vice versa."
- "A significant number of otherwise good answers omitted to mention the production of urine as the end result of all this, and the important fact that diuresis can be osmotically variable."
