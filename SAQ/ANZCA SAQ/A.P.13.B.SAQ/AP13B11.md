EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected that candidates would explain how the NSAIDS block cyclo-oxygenase enzymes, that there were two iso-enzymes and their bodily distribution and function."
- "The mechanisms of how they produce their wanted effects were expected i.e. in reducing pain, inflammation and pyrexia."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most candidates indicated the advantages of the COX-2 agents i.e. minimal gastric erosions, less bleeding and less alteration of renal blood flow auto regulation."
- "Some did not realise that bronchoconstriction in asthmatics is also minimalised."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Those candidates that did not score well did not elaborate sufficiently or did not answer part of the question."
- "Most candidates had mentioned the major disadvantage. This is increasing the balance of prostaglandins towards thrombosis in at risk patients."
