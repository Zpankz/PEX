title: "Describe the peripheral and central nervous system pathways that lead to the perception of pain following a laceration to the thumb."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2021
sitting: A
question: 05
passRate: 92.8
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The major domains assessed in this question were: definition of pain; nociceptors and transduction; spinal cord synapse; ascending and supraspinal pathways; cortical processing; descending modulation"
EC_extraCredit:
- "While a diagram was not required to pass the question, candidates who provided a simple, well-labelled diagram were able to better organise their answer and ensured that they addressed all the domains required."
- "It is recognised that textbooks differ in the nomenclature of the supraspinal pathways and the detail of cortical processing functions, and allowance was made for this."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "While peripheral nervous system and descending modulation pathways were generally well described, relatively few candidates recognised the emotional aspects and the autonomic responses associated with perception of pain."
