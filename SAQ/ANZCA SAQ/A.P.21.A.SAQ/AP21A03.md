title: "Outline the physiology of blood groups that allows O negative packed cells to be safely transfused to most patients."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2021
sitting: A
question: 03
passRate: 68.1
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The major domains assessed in this question were: physiology of ABO and Rhesus grouping; physiology of Incompatible transfusion reaction; explanation of why O neg blood is safe"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Credit was given for other relevant correct material."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common problems were: defining Rh status by antibody rather than antigen presence/absence; confusion over IgM and IgG antibodies, which blood group (ABO or Rhesus) they pertain to and which cross the placenta; using vague terminology to describe antigen/antibody reactions without specifying whether the antigen is in the donor or recipient and vice versa; describing group AB as presence of the “AB” antigen rather than the presence of A and B antigens; confusion over which Rh group can develop Rh antibodies and how these develop; lack of detail on why absence of an antigen/antigens equates with safety; only discussing one part of the question to the detriment of the other part - for example only discussing physiology of blood groups and not why O neg is safe or only discussing why O neg is safe not discussing physiology of blood grouping."
