title: "Describe the anatomy of the neonatal airway, and what implications this has for airway management."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2021
sitting: A
question: 07
passRate: 70.1
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question incorporated two parts - description of the neonatal airway and implications of the mentioned features on airway management."
- "This was concisely and effectively communicated by a two or three column table."
- "Important points to address were the size and shape of the occiput, the relative size of the tongue to the oral cavity, a description of the epiglottis, the position of the larynx and a description of the shape and relative size of the larynx and cricoid."
- "With relatively few facts being required to pass the question it was important to use precise language in the description of each feature"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common errors included the use of imprecise or vague descriptions of anatomical features or failing to describe the implication of each feature on airway management."
- "Descriptions of airway features of the neonate which were self-evident (for example, the airway is small), without explanation of the implication, failed to attract marks."
- "Many candidates provided lengthy descriptions of features of the neonatal cardiorespiratory system which were not related to the airway. No marks were awarded for this information."
