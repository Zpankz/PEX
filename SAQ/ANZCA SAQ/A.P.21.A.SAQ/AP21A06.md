exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2021
sitting: A
question: 06
passRate: 55.0
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main domains assessed in this question were: structure and classification; mechanism of action; pharmacokinetics; pharmacodynamics â€“ with particular emphasis on cardiovascular system effects"
- "Both metaraminol and adrenaline (epinephrine) are drugs commonly used by anaesthetists and therefore it was expected that candidates should have a thorough knowledge of their pharmacology to pass."
- "Many candidates utilised a table format and this lent itself well to a comparison of the two drugs across the required domains"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common problems included: lack of detail regarding mechanism of action (including adrenoreceptor selectivity); little pharmacokinetic information provided; superficial mention of the cardiovascular effects of the drugs; no mention of effects on other body systems"
- "The intracellular details of G-protein coupled receptor activation was not required and did not receive marks."
