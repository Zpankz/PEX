title: "Describe the V/Q ratio at the apex and base of the upright lung. How does this affect regional gas exchange?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2021
sitting: A
question: 08
passRate: 35.9
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question called firstly for a description and quantification of ventilation and perfusion as it is spread across the upright lung."
- "Better answers attempted the two topics separately and then proceeded to discuss how ventilation and perfusion are matched."
- "A correctly drawn diagram often aided the discussion."
- "The second part of the question called for a discussion on how the V/Q spread affects gas exchange."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Examples of gas tensions in lung units across different parts of the lung should have been included, as well as identification on how and why O2 and CO2 are affected differently."
- "Discussion of why well oxygenated alveoli do not compensate for the poorly oxygenated gained extra credit."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "There were two very repeatable reasons why some candidates did not score a pass mark: completely failing to discuss gas exchange; devoting the answer wholly, or largely to a discussion of West’s zones of the lung."
- "West’s zones is a model to conceptualise what may be occurring in terms of the relationship between vascular and alveolar pressures in different parts of the lung. It has relevance but should not be considered the whole story or even the basis of a discussion on V/Q mismatching."
