exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2021
sitting: A
question: 11
passRate: 29.9
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The major domains assessed in this question were: system components; Beer-Lambert law; differential absorption; isolation of the pulsatile component; converting ratio R to SpO2."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common problems with the answers included: incorrect use of the terms “SaO2”, “SpO2”, and “PaO2”; the misconception that only infrared light is used in pulse oximetry; limited or no application of the Beer-Lambert law to pulse oximetry; incorrect or contradictory statements about the absorption spectra for oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin; absent or insufficient explanation of the pulsatile or “alternating current” (AC) compartment."
