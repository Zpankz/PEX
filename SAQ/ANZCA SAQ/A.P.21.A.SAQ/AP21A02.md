title: "Describe the individual effects of propofol and sevoflurane on the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) and cerebral blood flow (CBF)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2021
sitting: A
question: 02
passRate: 35.9
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The major domains assessed in this question were: the effect of propofol on CMRO2, the effect of propofol on CBF, the effect of sevoflurane on CMRO2, the effect of sevoflurane on CBF."
- "Significant weight was given to a clear demonstration of: the triphasic nature of the MAC/CBF relationship for sevoflurane; a clear description of the direct association of decreased CMRO2 caused by propofol with a proportional decrease in CBF due to flow metabolism coupling."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Both agents decrease CMRO2 by inhibition neuronal activity through enhanced GABA mechanisms. The maximum reduction is 50-60% because a baseline of 40% CMRO2 is required for neuronal maintenance."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The commonest misconception was that a decrease in CBF associated with propofol was due to its systemic circulatory effects causing hypotension. This is only relevant at the lower limit of the auto regulatory curve."
- "A number of candidates suggested that reduction in CBF caused by propofol was “prevented” because auto regulation “was preserved”. Some candidates suggested that the CMRO2 is determined by CBF, reflecting a major misunderstanding of cerebral physiology."
- "Discussions of other physiological or pathological factors affecting CBF and CMRO2 not relating to the effect of propofol or sevoflurane did not attract marks."
