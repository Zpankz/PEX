title: "Describe the respiratory responses to hypoxaemia in both the awake and anaesthetised patient."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2021
sitting: A
question: 15
passRate: 62.2
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To pass the question candidates were expected to: define hypoxaemia; outline the components of the associated physiological control system (a brief discussion of the sensors, integrators, and effectors was considered sufficient); appreciate the relationship between respiratory drive/MV and PaO2; outline hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction; address some of the effects of anaesthesia upon those responses."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common errors included: confusion between carotid bodies and sinuses, and aortic bodies and arches; No credit was awarded for discussion of cardiovascular responses, nor for describing the response to hypercapnia (other than its effect on the response to hypoxaemia.) Simply repeating information already displayed clearly in graphical form attracted no additional credit."
