EC_extraCredit:
- "The first half of the question was reasonably well answered by candidates which is reflected in the high pass rate as this is where the bulk of marks where allocated."
- "Better answers included more detail and discussed effects on a wider variety of body systems."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates did not demonstrate an appreciation that the antiplatelet effects of these agents can be both a therapeutic and adverse effect depending on the clinical context."
- "Many answers gave the impression that bronchospasm was a frequent adverse effect rather than affecting a minority of patients with asthma."
- "The second half of the question was frequently answered with minimal detail and many errors."
- "Few candidates demonstrated an appreciation that the selectivity of COX-2 agents is not absolute nor identical within this class."
- "The major advantages of selective COX-2 agents include decreased long-term risk of gastric erosions, minimal effect on bronchial tone and reduced anti-platelet effects. This last benefit was overlooked by around half the candidates."
