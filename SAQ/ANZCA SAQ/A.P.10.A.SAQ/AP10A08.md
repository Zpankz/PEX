entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2010
sitting: A
question: 8
passRate: 32
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected for a pass included a classification of antidepressants according to mechanism of action, and therefore making some mention of the amine hypothesis of antidepressant effect. Then an outline of antidepressant â€“ perioperative drug interactions was expected: including pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. Many relevant interactions attracted marks, however, the important MAO inhibitor interactions were especially rewarded."
EC_extraCredit: []
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Although most candidates classified antidepressants according to mechanism of action, few connected this pharmacodynamically to the therapeutic antidepressant effect. Pharmacokinetic drug interactions were rarely included in answers and an explanation of what type of sympathomimetic that could be utilized perioperatively in patients taking MAO inhibitors was often omitted. Similarly, serotonin syndrome was frequently discussed as a SSRI interaction (where the severity is usually minor), but rarely so as a MAO inhibitor interaction where it can be severe."
- "Detailed descriptions of the pathology of depression were not expected."
