sitting: A
question: 6
passRate: 60
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This is a two parts question requiring candidates to list the various groups of drug for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, and to describe their mechanisms of action. It is important that sufficient details, such as molecular and metabolic effects after drug administration, are included for the latter part of the question."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates who included the newer agents, such as thiazolidinediones, alpha glucosidase inhibitors and meglitinides, were rewarded with extra marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Diabetes mellitus is a common condition faced daily by anaesthetists. A thorough understanding of its management is a clinical necessity."
- "While most candidates were able to describe the classical oral hypoglycemic agents (i.e. sulphonylureas and biguanides) in detail, it was surprising that a substantial proportion of candidates did not consider insulin as a drug for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Most answers were also vague regarding the different preparations of insulin that produce variation in the speed of onset and duration of action."
