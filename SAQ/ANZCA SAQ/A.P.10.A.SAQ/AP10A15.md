title: "Explain how cardiac output is measured using a thermodilution technique."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2010
sitting: A
question: 15
passRate: 60
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points in the answer should include: 1) A discussion of the basic principles involved. Thermodilution is based on the law of conservation of matter where heat lost from the blood = heat gained by injectate 12"
- "2) A description on the specifics of the technique mentioning the requirement of a Swan-Ganz catheter, nature of injectate and temperature measurement using a thermistor in the pulmonary artery."
- "3) An appreciation on how cardiac output is calculated from this technique"
- "4) A discussion of sources of errors which might affect the accuracy of the technique"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers include a short list of advantages and disadvantages of the technique."
- "Good answers mentioned that the thermodilution technique is a variation of the indicator dilution technique which uses the temperature decrease as the indicator."
- "Additional marks were given for a discussion on the Stewart-Hamilton Equation used to calculate flow/Q."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This question asked for an explanation of a specific technique of measuring cardiac output. Not directly relevant are: 1) A detailed discussion on cardiac output and the factors affecting it 2) Other techniques of cardiac output measurement 3) Explanation on how a thermistor functions"
- "Some candidates erroneously conclude that cardiac output IS the area under the curve. Other candidates confuse the PiCCO as a thermodilution technique."
