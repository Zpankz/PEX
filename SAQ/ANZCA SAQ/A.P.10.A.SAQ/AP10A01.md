title: "Describe how the chemical structure of local anaesthetic drugs determines their efficacy and safety."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2010
sitting: A
question: 1
passRate: 36
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The answer needed to be related to the structure of local anaesthetics and could be divided into effects on efficacy and safety. This means looking at the lipophilic, intermediate, and hydrophilic components. Increases in side chain length generally result in increased lipid solubility, potency, and protein binding up to a point. This also increases toxicity, duration of action, and slows the onset/offset. The differences between the ester and amide link in regards to metabolism, allergy, and duration of action need to be covered. Other aspects needed to gain marks included the effects of chirality and acid-base changes."
EC_extraCredit: []
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This could be considered core material, although many candidates lost marks by spent a time on non-relevant information such as describing local anaesthetic toxicity, mechanisms of action, and routes of administration."
- "Other common errors included: making imprecise statements (for example, 'the structure determines what the pKa and lipid solubility will be', without saying how), writing lengthy introductions that don't make a point, repeating the same point multiple times, and stating that prilocaine is an ester local anaesthetic."
