EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to describe how the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase results in both positive and negative clinical effects of NSAIDs. Many candidates did not link the reduction in prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxane and interleukin to specific NSAID actions such as anti-pyrexia, analgesia and anti-inflammation. Physiological actions of prostaglandins and thromboxane were described but did not gain marks unless related to the clinical effects of NSAIDs. Marks were awarded for differentiating the isoforms of cyclo-oxygenase and the logic behind preferentially inhibiting COX-2. A structured approach naming the clinical effects of NSAIDs and how they occur through manipulation of eicosanoid production gained higher marks."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were awarded for describing the effects of NSAIDs on bone formation, the ductus arteriosus, the pregnant uterus and bowel cancer."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Confusion occurred regarding the effect of COX-2 selective agents on asthma. Generally the precipitation of asthma is reduced. Omitting the allergic potential of COX-2 inhibitors and the fact that Parecoxib is a pro-drug were common."
