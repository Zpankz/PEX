entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2010
sitting: A
question: 16
passRate: 60
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The following were the main points expected in answering the question: Clear descriptions of the following mechanisms of transport across cellular membranes; • Exocytosis and endocytosis • Diffusion, with an appropriate explanation. Better answers included relevant application of Fick's Law of Diffusion • Movement through ion channels and aquaporins, with ion channel subtypes identified • Carrier mediated transport, with discussion of facilitated diffusion, primary and secondary active transport."
- "It was expected that relevant examples of each transport mechanism were included."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were awarded for a clear, well structured answer, with appropriate examples offered for key processes."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Detailed discussions of diffusion mechanisms, with inadequate attention to other processes"
- "Incorrect or absent examples of key processes"
- "Describing facilitated diffusion as an example of active transport"
- "Confusing co-transport and counter-transport mechanisms."
