EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question required candidates to describe the effects, but most simply gave a list of apparently random effects of the drug. The anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects were often not well covered and the fact that these could be either therapeutic or unwanted depending on the indication for the drug usually overlooked."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates failed to distinguish adequately between the side effects of long and short term use and few mentioned the need for replacement therapy in patients who have recently been on the drug."
