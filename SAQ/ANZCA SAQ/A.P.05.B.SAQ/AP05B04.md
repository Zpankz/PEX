title: "Define the term ‘context-sensitive half time’. How does it differ from the half life typically quoted for a drug? Illustrate this concept by comparing thiopentone vs. propofol and fentanyl vs. remifentanil."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2005
sitting: B
question: 4
passRate: 73
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected for a pass included: Context sensitive half time (CST1/2); the time for plasma concentration to decrease by 50% after termination of an infusion. The “context” is infusion duration. Determinants of CST1/2 including clearance, distribution to and from peripheral compartments and duration of infusion. Elimination half life (T1/2); the time for plasma concentration or total drug amount in body to decrease by 50% during the elimination phase. The principal determinant of T1/2 is clearance. T1/2 is typically described after a bolus dose. (Plasma concentration or total drug amount were both accepted as they are used interchangeably in many of the prescribed texts). An outline of the different CST½ for thiopentone, propofol, fentanyl and remifentanil"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers included: A demonstrated understanding of the concepts with explanations for the differences between the drugs and different infusion durations. Accurate diagrams demonstrating CST1/2 for the four drugs including correctly labelled axes. An explanation of T1/2 with reference to the equation T1/2 = .693Vd/Cl"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Errors included: No consideration of the factors effecting CST1/2 or T1/2. Regurgitation of kinetic data with no reference to the important data pertaining to CST1/2 or explanation of the data. Extremely inaccurate diagrams with no labelling of axes. Confusion between the terms CST1/2 and effect site concentration"
