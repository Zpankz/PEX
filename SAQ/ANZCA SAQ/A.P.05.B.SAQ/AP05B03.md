title: "Write brief notes on the physico-chemical properties of lidocaine (lignocaine)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2005
sitting: B
question: 03
passRate: 53
EC_expectedDomains:
- "In asking for physicochemical details of lignocaine, the information that the examiners were seeking included: the chemical structure, the fact that the structure is an amide and a weak base, an explanation of how the chemical structure of the lignocaine molecule relates to its activity, the pKa, degree of ionisation under physiological conditions and how this can be altered by changes in pH, molecular weight and oil:water partition co-efficient, or some mention of lipid solubility."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The candidates that scored well on this question usually needed to write little more than one page."
- "Only a few candidates mentioned that lignocaine base is poorly soluble and that lignocaine local anaesthetic products are formulated as the hydrochloride salt to overcome this problem."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Critically, many candidates spent valuable time writing pages of details of the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic effects of the drug which were clearly not called for, and therefore sadly scored no marks."
- "This question serves to remind candidates of how information on pharmacological topics needs to be organised."
- "It is content rather than amount written that is important."
