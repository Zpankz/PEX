entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2005
sitting: B
question: 02
passRate: 83
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The requirements of the question are clearly set out. Therefore, it is important to use opioids as examples and to illustrate the concepts with graphs."
- "As a whole, this is a straight forward question and the concepts are well known to most candidates."
EC_extraCredit:
- "While it is efficient to incorporate all curves into a single graph, candidates using this approach often have difficulty in marking the changes clearly."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Other common mistakes included failure to highlight the key components in the graph (e.g. ED50, maximal effect) and to label the axes accurately."
- "In particular, it is often unclear as to which drug is being increased in the x-axis (dose or log dose)."
- "It is also apparent that a number of candidates are confused with the difference between graded and quantal dose response curves."
