title: "Describe how isoflurane is metabolised. In your answer give reasons why the overall extent of metabolism of isoflurane is so low."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2005
sitting: B
question: 01
passRate: 44
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Expected in the answer to this question was some description of what isoflurane was."
- "That metabolism occurred in the liver was mentioned by the majority of candidates but fewer went on to describe cytochrome P450 as the predominant mechanism."
- "The breakdown products TFA and fluoride ions were discussed by most but only about half of the candidates mentioned both."
- "Finally most candidates discussed the position, number and inherent stability of the C-F bond as well as the relatively low solubility of isoflurane as being important in its low rate of metabolism."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers mentioned the CYP450 2E1 as being the relevant isoform and the relative significance of kidney CYP450 (vs. methoxyflurane)."
- "Potential end organ toxicity (liver and kidney respectively) and the relevance of this compared to older agents was discussed by a minority of candidates."
- "Very few candidates could describe the breakdown sequence of isoflurane, though this was not required to pass."
- "Only a minority mentioned both factors however."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A surprisingly wide range of percentage liver metabolism was provided, the most frequent error being 2% when in fact it is only 0.2%."
- "A majority of candidates provided a formula (a few incorrectly) and a minority just a written description."
- "Degradation of isoflurane in soda lime was not considered to be metabolism."
