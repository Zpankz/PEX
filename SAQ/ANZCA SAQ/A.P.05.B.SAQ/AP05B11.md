college: ANZCA
year: 2005
sitting: B
question: 11
passRate: 75
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were awarded for detailed description of the ABO antigens, discussion of the biological basis for the development of anti-A and anti-B antibodies, description of the adverse effects of incompatible transfusion, recognition of the clinical significance of Rh (D) antibody generation in Rh- negative patients and a detailed description of the cross-match process."
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The core components expected in the answer were the principles of ABO, Rh and other antibody testing and the cross-match process. This was well handled by most candidates."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The commonest source of confusion related to the cross-match process. Although many candidates were able to give a good description of the indirect Coombs test for antibody compatibility, relatively few candidates recognized that the first stage of the cross-match process (at room temperature) was mainly a further check of ABO compatibility and that the indirect Coombs test was only performed if the recipient had a positive antibody screen."
