title: "Explain how cardiac output is measured using a thermodilution technique."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2005
sitting: B
question: 13
passRate: 53
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected for a pass included a definition of cardiac output, relationship of the Fick principle to thermodilution, description of measurement technique and the relationship between the curve generated and the cardiac output and the advantages of this technique over other alternatives."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional points were given for descriptions of the equipment required for measurement, the inaccuracies of measurement and methods for overcoming these inaccuracies, disadvantages of this technique over others and more mathematical descriptions of the method of calculation."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common mistakes included not defining cardiac output, confusion over the relationship between the area under the curve and the cardiac output, and reproducing the dye dilution curve instead of the change in temperature curve."
