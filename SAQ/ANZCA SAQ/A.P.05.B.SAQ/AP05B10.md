title: "Describe the forces acting across the glomerular capillary membrane. Explain how afferent and efferent arteriolar tone affect glomerular filtration rate."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2005
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 62
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question was in two parts. The first part required a description of the hydrostatic and oncotic forces favouring and opposing filtration from the glomerular capillaries. The use of normal values was helpful in showing how these forces differed from other capillary beds. Many candidates correctly wrote out the Starling Equation, but offered no description of the forces. A detailed description of the filtration and reflection coefficients was not required. The second part of the question required an understanding of how changes in afferent and efferent arteriolar tone affected glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and hence glomerular filtration."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers described the relationship between renal blood flow and glomerular filtration with these changes. Few candidates were aware that moderate efferent vasoconstriction increased glomerular filtration, but large changes in tone caused a decrease."
