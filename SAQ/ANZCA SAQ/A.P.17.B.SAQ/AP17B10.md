title: "Describe the physiological processes that influence the rate of gastric emptying."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2017
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 29
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected are best organised into local, neural and humoral control of gastric emptying of chyme into the duodenum."
- "Candidates with a clear understanding of the reason for the coordinated emptying scored better in this question, which had asked for a description of physiological processes."
EC_extraCredit:
- "However, a number of candidates were also awarded marks for pathophysiological and pharmacological factors; if there was prior demonstration of knowledge of normal physiology."
- "Only a few candidates correctly pointed out that pregnancy does not delay gastric emptying; but the stress of labour does."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Answering in tabular format, which listed factors that increase or decrease gastric emptying without further discussion."
- "Answering in a clinical approach (patient, surgical and anaesthetic factors), which led to omission of essential physiological facts."
- "Confusion about the hormones that are involved and their exact effects on gastric emptying."
- "Regurgitation of fasting guidelines for patients without explaining the physiological basis for these guidelines."
- "Detailed discussion of gastric acid production or function of the lower oesophageal sphincter, which is not within the scope of this question."
