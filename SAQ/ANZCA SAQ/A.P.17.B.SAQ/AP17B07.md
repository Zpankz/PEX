question: 07
passRate: 61
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were required to compare the pharmacology of ephedrine and noradrenaline."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates who scored highly included the above (with correct information), and discussed clinically relevant and important points about the drugs that fall outside the above sections."
- "Often candidates who scored well were able to discuss the differences in structure between the two medications and what the implications of these structural differences are."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "It was difficult to score highly if a structure such as uses, pharmaceutics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, side effects and interactions was not used."
- "Common errors included being vague with answers (e.g. “works at adrenoreceptors”), over-estimating the beta effects of ephedrine, only including cardiovascular effects of the drugs and not being aware of the clinical relevance of structural differences between the two medications."
- "Some candidates answered the question using adrenaline instead of ephedrine and candidates are reminded to read short answer questions carefully."
