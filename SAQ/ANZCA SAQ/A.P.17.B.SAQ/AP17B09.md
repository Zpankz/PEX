title: "Draw and explain the characteristics of a quantal dose-response curve that describes the major clinical effect of rocuronium. Outline medications and medical conditions that may cause the curve to shift to the left or right."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2017
sitting: B
question: 09
passRate: 68
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The first part required drawing a quantal dose response curve for Rocuronium with correctly labelled axes and description of the various phases."
- "To score well in this section it was necessary to demonstrate understanding that a quantal dose response curve refers to a population, measures a binary endpoint and what this endpoint is in the case of neuromuscular blockers."
- "The second part of the question required an outline of factors which shift the curve to the left or right."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The fact that ED95 when discussing neuromuscular blockers is in fact the ED50 of 95% twitch reduction in a population was explained by the better scoring candidates."
- "To score marks it was necessary to define for each factor the direction in which the curve shifted."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates are reminded that some factors which affect the duration of action of neuromuscular blockers do not necessarily affect the dose response curve."
