title: "Describe the determinants of left ventricular myocardial oxygen supply and demand."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2017
sitting: B
question: 13
passRate: 50
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A good answer required a discussion of both supply and demand."
- "Myocardial oxygen supply depends on coronary blood flow and arterial oxygen content."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most answers gave a reasonable account of coronary flow using the hydraulic analogue of Ohm’s Law."
- "Good answers discussed the influence of heart rate on both the supply and demand aspects of myocardial oxygen balance."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "There was some confusion about the basis of coronary perfusion pressure and the fate of LV coronary flow during systole."
- "Many candidates neglected to discuss the determinants of arterial oxygen content."
- "In describing the physiology of LV oxygen demand, there appeared to be considerable confusion about the contribution of LV wall tension."
- "Terms such as “tension”, “stress", “afterload", and “pressure" were often used very loosely."
- "The Law of Laplace was frequently invoked but not always applied correctly to the question."
