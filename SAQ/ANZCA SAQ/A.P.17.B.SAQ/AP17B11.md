EC_expectedDomains:
- "Better answers included a structured description of pathophysiological changes, either organised by organ system with comments on the effect of various mediators or vice versa"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The commonest misconception regarding the immunology of anaphylaxis was that lgE antibodies are free in the circulation and bind to the allergens at the time of exposure, then trigger mast cell degranulation. The truth is that they are bound to the surface of sensitised mast cells and degranulate when the allergen binds to the antibody."
