title: "a) Describe the immediate cardiovascular responses to the sudden loss of 30% of the blood volume in a healthy awake person. b) How are these responses different if the patient is undergoing anaesthesia with sevoflurane?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2017
sitting: B
question: 03
passRate: 67
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The two parts of the question carried the same weight."
- "A good answer to the first part included the effects on the cardiovascular system as a result of a 30% loss of blood volume, followed by the various compensation mechanisms."
- "The focus of the second part of the question should be on the pharmacodynamics effects of sevoflurane on the cardiovascular system, and how these effects will be exacerbated in a patient with hypovolaemia."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better candidates demonstrated understanding that sevoflurane blunts the responsiveness of baroreceptors in a dose dependent manner."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Detailed anatomical descriptions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems were not required."
- "Discussions on the effects of intravenous anaesthesia, mechanical ventilation or the treatment of hypotension did not attract marks."
