EC_expectedDomains:
- "Most candidates drew an acceptable schematic diagram of a vaporiser and its major components."
- "Temperature compensation provided by the bimetallic strip was well understood."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Some candidates were able to calculate splitting ratios from first principles."
- "Candidates could have obtained additional marks by discussing the extrinsic factors that impede the ability of the vaporiser to achieve the dialled concentration."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates struggled to explain vaporiser function succinctly."
- "At times, it was unclear whether candidates were referring to ambient temperature or vaporiser temperature."
- "Many candidates made erroneous statements contradicting the basic laws of thermodynamics."
- "The function of the heat sink was frequently misunderstood."
