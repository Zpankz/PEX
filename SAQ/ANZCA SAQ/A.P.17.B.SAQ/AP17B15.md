title: "Write brief notes on the pharmacology of tramadol."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2017
sitting: B
question: 15
passRate: 68
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Marks were awarded for stating that Tramadol is a racemic mixture and that both enantiomers are required for analgesic activity."
- "Marks were also awarded for correctly naming the active metabolite of Tramadol and its significance."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better candidates could correctly identify which enantiomer caused which particular pharmacology action."
- "Bonus marks were awarded for stating Tramadol’s interaction with other drugs used in anaesthesia."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates incorrectly stated that Tramadol is a serotonin or noradrenaline agonist; it inhibits reuptake and thereby increases the availability of these biologic amines in the synaptic cleft."
- "Listing the effects/side effects of tramadol without quantifying how these differ from other analgesics did not get awarded marks."
- "Writing pages on pharmacogenetics did not get awarded marks – this was asked in the last exam."
- "Many candidates omitted the fact that Tramadol and its metabolites also undergo phase II reactions."
- "Candidates used the pharmaceutical, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetic model to answer the question. However, many clearly made up values for lipid solubility, pKa, protein binding and volume of distribution. Guessing does not get awarded marks."
