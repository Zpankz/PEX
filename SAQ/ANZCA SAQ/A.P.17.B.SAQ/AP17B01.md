title: "Describe the visceral and somatic pain of labour with particular reference to the anatomy of the pain pathways."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2017
sitting: B
question: 01
passRate: 20
lo:
- "[[SS_OB 1.8]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points required for a pass mark were an adequate description of pain in labour and an outline of the neural pathways that are involved."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers contained a brief description of the 3 stages of labour with an explanation of how and why pain changes with each stage."
- "Better answers contained descriptions of visceral labour pain (which is predominant in the first stage) associated with uterine contractions and cervical dilatation, including where this is felt, why it changes in intensity, and an explanation of why the pain can be referred and poorly localised."
- "Better answers contained a discussion of somatic pain (which is predominant in the second stage of labour), including where this is felt and an explanation of why it is localised."
- "Better answers contained the location and activation of nociceptors, A delta and C nerve fibres."
- "Better answers contained detail regarding the innervation of uterus, cervix and other tissues – including relevant peripheral nerves and spinal segments."
- "Better answers contained a concise (and accurate) description of the pain pathways from the nociceptor to the CNS."
- "Additional marks could be earned by briefly mentioning other ascending pain pathways apart from the spinothalamic tract and the role of descending inhibitory pathways."
- "Additional marks could be earned by briefly mentioning the role/utility of epidural or spinal anaesthesia to treat or manage labour pain."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates failed to address the first part of the question, and many did not mention pain in labour at all in their answer."
- "A generic description of pain pathways was not enough for a pass mark."
- "Most answers included diagrams to illustrate pain pathways from a peripheral nerve to the CNS (which were given credit). However, many of these contained errors. Brief notes helped to demonstrate understanding of the important points."
- "The innervation of the uterus, cervix, and pelvic structures (with nerves and spinal segments) was described incorrectly or not discussed."
- "Many candidates wasted minutes by writing wordy definitions of all of the terms in the question – including ‘pain’ and ‘labour’ – where many more marks could have been earned addressing the main point of the question."
- "Some candidates made inaccurate statements about the utility of epidural or spinal analgesia to treat labour pain."
resources:
- "Candidates are advised to refer to the prescribed textbooks where this topic is covered well – including ‘Clinical Pain Management: Acute Pain’ – Pamela Macintyre."
