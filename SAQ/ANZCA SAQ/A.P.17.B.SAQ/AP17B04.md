title: "a) Describe the generation and features of a normal awake EEG (15 marks). b) Briefly discuss the processing performed by quantitative EEG monitors (such as BIS or Entropy) to produce a single number from the EEG (10 marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2017
sitting: B
question: 04
passRate: 23
EC_expectedDomains:
- "In the first part of the question, candidates’ answers should include that EEG is the summation of excitatory and inhibitory potentials of the cortical pyramidal cells."
- "EEG is typically small with low voltage in the order of 0-200 μV."
- "The EEG is characterized by its frequency and amplitude of the waveform."
- "The question clearly asked for the methods that convert complex EEG waveform into a single number."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A few candidates were able to recall the four main frequency bands (<4 Hz, δ wave; 4–8 Hz, θ wave; 8–13 Hz, α wave; and >13 Hz, β wave), but many of the figures were often incorrectly cited."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "It should be noted that normal EEG in an awake individual is asynchronous, of low voltage and high frequency."
- "The majority of candidates misinterpreted the second part of the question, and provided answers to highlight the utility of the processed EEG."
