EC_expectedDomains:
- "The best answers used a systems based approach and gave appropriate clinical examples e.g. a 20% reduction in SVR may cause hypotension and require the use of vasopressor socaution is required especially in the elderly."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Many candidates answered the question sufficiently with regard to the cardiovascular and respiratory system, but provided minimal detail and clinical information about other systems."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Despite the question specifically requesting only information related to the pharmacodynamics, and how these influence clinical use, many candidates wasted time on descriptions of the general pharmacology, including its indications, dosage, mechanism of action and chemical structure."
