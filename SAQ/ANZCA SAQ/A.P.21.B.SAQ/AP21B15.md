title: "Discuss factors that determine the time to awakening after cessation of a propofol target controlled infusion (TCI)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2021
sitting: B
question: 15
passRate: 32
EC_expectedDomains:
- "an explanation of awakening"
- "discussion of propofol clearance and intercompartmental distribution (in the setting of an infusion)"
- "the effects of infusion duration"
- "pharmacodynamic factors affecting time to wake"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers explained awakening in terms of effect site propofol concentrations."
- "A detailed discussion of propofol clearance and intercompartmental distribution was expected."
- "Few candidates explained that (unless severe) hepatic dysfunction does not significantly affect propofol clearance."
- "Higher scoring candidates discussed compartmental redistribution after ceasing a short propofol infusion vs a longer duration infusion."
- "More complete answers defined and discussed the context sensitive half time of propofol and also decrement times as another measure associated with awakening time."
- "Age, interindividual variation, and administration of other drugs (with detail and discussion about how and why they alter awakening) also scored marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "listing formulae and pharmacokinetic data without linking them to the question."
- "illegible writing."
- "confusion regarding intercompartmental redistribution after stopping the infusion."
- "complex and lengthy descriptions of different infusion models (Marsh/Schnider) did not gain a proportionate number of marks."
