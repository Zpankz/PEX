title: "Explain the physiological effects of acute hypercapnia, caused by hypoventilation."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2021
sitting: B
question: 11
passRate: 30
EC_expectedDomains:
- "adequately describe the effects of hypercapnia on several body systems"
- "Core body systems included the central nervous system, cardiovascular system (cardiac and systemic effects) and respiratory system."
- "Effects on endocrine, renal or other systems and integration with acid-base control"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates commonly gave long descriptions of the effects of carbon dioxide on the normal control of ventilation, which was not the question."
- "no definition of hypercapnia"
- "effects of hypercapnia on cerebral blood flow were expected, but in-depth descriptions of the Monro-Kellie hypothesis were not required"
- "many candidates discussed the alveolar gas equation, and risk of hypoxia from hypercapnia, but few candidates stated that this effect is minor compared to the risk of hypoxia from hypoventilation (FiO2 0.3 is sufficient to compensate for PACO2 of 100 mm Hg)."
- "inclusion of diagrams without labelled axes which made them impossible to interpret."
