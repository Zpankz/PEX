title: "Draw, label and describe the waveforms and pressures that are seen in each anatomical location during insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2021
sitting: B
question: 5
passRate: 37
EC_expectedDomains:
- "the correct pulmonary artery catheter waveform from CVP/RA, RV, PA to PCWP"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Overall knowledge of the CVP waveform was good."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "lack of knowledge from the RV and beyond"
- "lack of written description to accompany poorly drawn or otherwise incorrect graphs inconsistency between what is written and drawn or vice versa (e.g. drawing a dichrotic notch but offering no explanation, or explaining a dichrotic notch but not adding it to diagram.)"
- "a lack of recognition that the CVP and RA waveforms are the same, there being significant differences between the RV and PA systolic pressures, and where exactly a PAC is “wedged”."
