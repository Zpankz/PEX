title: "Describe the effects of perioperative hypothermia. DO NOT discuss mechanisms of heat loss."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2021
sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 33
EC_expectedDomains:
- "a definition of a temperature range or ranges"
- "homeostatic compensatory effects"
- "individual end-organ physiological effects"
- "relevant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "lengthy descriptions of thermoregulatory mechanisms (including mechanisms of heat loss) which did not attract marks"
- "limited information on pertinent perioperative issues"
- "failing to recognise that perioperative hypothermia is typically mild, producing physiological effects which are often the opposite of severe hypothermia seen in severe cold exposure. An example being effects on the cardiovascular system, where mild hypothermia leads to shivering, vasoconstriction and increased SNS outflow causing tachycardia, hypertension and increased myocardial oxygen demand."
