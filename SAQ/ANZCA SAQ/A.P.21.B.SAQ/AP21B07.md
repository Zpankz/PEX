title: "Describe the normal regulation of cerebral blood flow and outline physiological factors which may alter it. DO NOT discuss the effect of medications or pathology."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2021
sitting: B
question: 7
passRate: 35
EC_expectedDomains:
- "an understanding of normal cerebral blood flow"
- "an explanation of the major mechanisms that control it"
- "and the physiological factors that altered flow."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Credit was given to answers that appreciated the importance of cerebral blood flow for the brain’s specific metabolic requirements."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "lengthy descriptions about intracerebral pressure physiology and systemic blood pressure homeostasis. These are tangential topics that often prevented candidates from achieving more complete answers."
- "Poor word choice was also a problem specifically with the term “reflex” which was used colloquially but in medicine denotes a neural mediated response."
