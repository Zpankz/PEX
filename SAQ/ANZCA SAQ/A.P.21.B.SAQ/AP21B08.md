entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2021
sitting: B
question: 8
passRate: 65
EC_expectedDomains:
- "understand the effects are dose-dependent"
- "describe respiration pattern changes - respiratory rate, tidal volume and overall minute ventilation."
- "describe the impact on ventilation in response to rise in PaCO2 and fall in PaO2."
- "describe bronchodilatory effect of sevoflurane and its mechanism."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Credit was given for other points of relevance."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "incorrectly stating that there was dose dependent decrease in respiratory rate"
- "giving simple statements without any explanation"
- "discussing the mechanism of action of sevoflurane extensively without making association with how this affects respiratory function"
