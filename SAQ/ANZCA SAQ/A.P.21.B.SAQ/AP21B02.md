title: "Briefly outline the mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers produce a) their therapeutic effects  b) potential adverse effects"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2021
sitting: B
question: 2
passRate: 49
EC_expectedDomains:
- "the mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers interact with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to mediate changes in medium to long term control of blood pressure, as well as important adverse effects relevant to the perioperative setting"
- "correct mechanisms of action of these drugs, particularly the effects of inhibition of Angiotensin II"
- "Effects on the sympathetic nervous system, peripheral vasculature and accurate descriptions of mechanisms of salt and water retention"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "stating that hypokalaemia and hyponatraemia were adverse effects"
- "omission of important adverse effects such as perioperative hypotension, hyperkalaemia and renal impairment"
- "stating that orthostatic hypotension was one of the adverse effects even though baroreceptor function and cardiovascular reflexes are preserved, and postural changes to blood pressure are unimpaired."
