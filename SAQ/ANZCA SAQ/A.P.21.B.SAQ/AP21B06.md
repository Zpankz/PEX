title: "Explain how local anaesthetics prevent the conduction of action potentials within a major peripheral nerve."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2021
sitting: B
question: 6
passRate: 51
EC_expectedDomains:
- "a brief outline of normal nerve action potential physiology"
- "pharmacokinetic factors that govern how local anaesthetics permeate the neural tissue"
- "binding of local anaesthetics to voltage-gated sodium channels"
- "what effect this has on action potential conduction within a major peripheral nerve"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most candidates gave a reasonable explanation for how local anaesthetics interact with sodium channels, and how this affects action potential conduction – although many answers contained confusing, incorrect or internally inconsistent explanations about the various confirmational states of the sodium channel."
- "Diagrams of sodium channels and/or nerve action potentials (when correctly drawn) helped alleviate this confusion."
- "Fick’s law of diffusion was often invoked to help explain the relevant pharmacokinetic principles (i.e. how pKa/pH affects ionization and therefore diffusion), however candidates sometimes struggled to explain how “surface area” and “thickness” were relevant in the context of a peripheral nerve block."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "implying that the main barrier to diffusion was the axonal membrane"
- "referring only to “myelinated nerves” (peripheral nerves are mixed sensorimotor nerves containing both myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibres)"
- "confusing nerve action potentials with cardiac action potentials"
- "incorrect explanations for how sodium channel blockade prevents membrane depolarisation"
- "discussing neuraxial, subcutaneous or transdermal routes of administration"
