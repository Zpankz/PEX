title: "Discuss possible causes for the PaCO2 differing from the ETCO2 in an anaesthetised, intubated patient on IPPV."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2021
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 27
EC_expectedDomains:
- "An account of the normal arterial to end-tidal CO2 gap"
- "Patient causes: dead space, incomplete emptying"
- "Monitoring/equipment errors: IR related, other"
EC_extraCredit:
- "an outline of dead space (although an explanation of how it caused a CO2 gap was often lacking)"
- "a description of the “Other” equipment factors"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "not accounting for the normal gap"
- "omitting “incomplete exhalation”, and what that does to ETCO2"
- "not understanding the cause of dead space in low cardiac output states"
- "confusing shunt and dead space"
- "erroneously assuming that anything that increase CO2 production (eg increased metabolism) also increase the CO2 gap. Similarly for exhausted soda-lime, pneumoperitoneum."
- "confusion over collision broadening"
