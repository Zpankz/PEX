title: "a) Define \"volume of distribution\". What factors influence the size of the volume of distribution? b) How may it be used in the calculation of a loading dose? What assumptions are made in this calculation?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2021
sitting: B
question: 3
passRate: 60
EC_expectedDomains:
- "correct definition of volume of distribution (Vd)"
- "discussion on the drug, patient and pathological factors which influence the size of Vd"
- "explanation of loading dose with a correct equation that incorporated Vd"
- "outline of the assumptions made with the above calculation based on pharmacokinetic principles"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Leniency was applied to the definition and alternative terms for “apparent” were accepted."
- "Few candidates demonstrated a clear understanding why this volume is “apparent”."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "many candidates attributed increased Vd to high protein binding. Although this is true for amiodarone (a frequently quoted example), its large Vd is due to high lipid solubility and avid binding to tissue proteins after long term therapy. Very few drugs have the same pharmacokinetic property as amiodarone. In general pharmacokinetics, the effects of plasma proteins are crucial in highly protein-bound drugs given intravenously because binding to plasma proteins render crossing of membranes difficult and confine the drug within the vascular compartment."
- "The second section of the question was frequently poorly answered with minimal detail."
- "Many answers contain repetitions if candidates chose to discuss the assumptions made based on the factors which they already discussed earlier."
- "Some answers included discussion of half-lives of drugs or a diagram of the multi-compartment model which were not required to pass this question."
