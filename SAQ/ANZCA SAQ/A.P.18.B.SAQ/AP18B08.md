entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2018
sitting: B
question: 08
passRate: 73
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To pass, candidates were required to give a broad list of functions including water and electrolyte homeostasis and excretion of metabolic waste products PLUS at least two other functions."
- "It was further required that there was some discussion about the significance of these functions and underlying mechanisms."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Specialist anaesthetic practice requires a clear understanding of kidney function."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Beyond homeostasis of water and electrolytes, many physiology and pharmacology references cover kidney functions in the context of broader topics. For example, metabolic processes, including drug and chemical biotransformation, may be better understood from pharmacokinetic chapters. Endocrine functions may be covered in a corresponding section of text; such as erythropoietin secretion which is typically described in red blood cell production."
