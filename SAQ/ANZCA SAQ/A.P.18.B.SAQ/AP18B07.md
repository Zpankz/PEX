title: "Using opioids as examples, describe and illustrate with graphs, what you understand by the terms “potency”, “efficacy”, “partial agonist”, “competitive antagonist” and “therapeutic index”."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2018
sitting: B
question: 07
passRate: 45
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question asked for a definition, opioid example and illustrative graph for each of five pharmacodynamic terms."
- "A high degree precision was expected."
- "To pass, candidates were expected to provide definitions and examples for four of the terms, draw accurately labelled graphs, and distinguish between quantal and graded dose-response curves."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Things done well: Defining partial agonist, efficacy and competitive antagonist, Rating the potencies of common opioids, Naloxone was frequently well-cited"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common errors included: Confusion between quantal and graded response curves, Indicating ED50 / EC50 as other than a point on the abscissa, Inconsistent labelling of graph axes, Confusing affinity, efficacy and potency, Using non-opioid examples (very common), Incorrect effect of a competitive antagonist, Descriptions of inverse agonism which was not required, Defining the Therapeutic Index graphically as a range, Not using examples for Therapeutic Index, Writing answers with a high level of assumed knowledge"
