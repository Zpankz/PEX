title: "List the drugs which affect uterine tone and outline the adverse effects of these agents."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2018
sitting: B
question: 13
passRate: 72
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To pass this question, answers needed to include classification of at least four drugs that increase or decrease uterine tone, along with at least one side effect for each drug included."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers contained more detail such as differentiating the effects of the various prostaglandins, not all of which cause bronchoconstriction."
- "Class-wide side effects such as PPH for tocolytics and foetal asphyxia for drugs increasing uterine tone demonstrated understanding and insight."
- "Discussion of the minimal effect of ketamine at clinically used doses attracted marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "An answer that did not include oxytocin, given it is used before, during or after virtually every delivery could not achieve a pass."
- "The question did not ask for mechanisms of action or dosing and infusion regimens. These were commonly provided at length and wasted valuable time."
- "There were some more common errors. Nifedipine causing bradycardia is rare in this patient cohort; reflex tachycardia is much more common. The serious side effects of magnesium occur at quite high plasma concentrations and are different from those found at lower concentration. The haemodynamic effects of oxytocin and ergometrine were occasionally incorrect."
- "Drugs used in the treatment of pre-eclampsia (labetolol and hydralazine) and other drugs without effects on uterine tone afforded no marks."
