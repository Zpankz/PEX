title: "Describe the factors determining transdermal uptake of drugs (50%). Briefly outline the advantages and disadvantages of transdermal administration of drugs (50%)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2018
sitting: B
question: 14
passRate: 33
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To pass, candidates had had to define Fick’s equation correctly AND have further examples or specifics, and to outline the advantages and disadvantages of using this as a route of administration."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better performing candidates would explain the type of solubility that was important and why, and use examples to make their point."
- "High scoring candidates often mentioned factors outside the Fick’s equation, or indirectly related to this equation and often used clinical examples as to hose these factors could occur."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Poorly performing candidates often wrote the Fick’s equation and then did not expand on the components of this equation."
- "It is not enough to write, for example, that increased solubility increases the uptake, as the equation has already mentioned this."
- "Overall there was a lack of detail in the answers, a lack of clinical application and a lack of examples of medications used transdermally."
