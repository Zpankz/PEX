title: "Outline the mechanisms of action of the drugs, with examples, which increase myocardial contractility."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2018
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 52
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The wording of question points to the focus of the answer. The focus should be the mechanism of action of increasing myocardial contraction, or positive inotropy."
- "To pass, candidates were expected to provide 3 or more examples of positive inotropes, and included some discussion on the mechanisms of action."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Drug examples should then follow as the second part of the answer."
- "The better candidates were able to provide detailed mechanisms for increasing inotropy first, with some providing up to 6 â€“ 7 examples."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates who could only provide a list of various drugs without giving correct mechanism of actions had difficulty passing."
- "A number of candidates were not able to define myocardial contractility correctly, which should be independent of heart rate, preload and afterload."
- "Candidates who answered the question with purely symbols and/or non-conventional abbreviations to indicate directions of change and mechanisms of action were not able to attain very high marks."
