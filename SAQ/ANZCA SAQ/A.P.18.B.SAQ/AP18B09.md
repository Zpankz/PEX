title: "Describe the autonomic innervation of the heart (60%), and the effects of autonomic stimulation on cardiac function (40%)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2018
sitting: B
question: 09
passRate: 67
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To pass the first part of this question (60%), a description of the anatomy of cardiac autonomic supply was required."
- "The second part of the question (40%) called for a discussion of the physiological effects of stimulation of these nerves on cardiac function."
EC_extraCredit:
- "This was best done in a systematic manner starting from the origins of the cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic fibres to the course that these nerves traverse to the heart."
- "Answers that included a discussion of the differential cardiac distribution of the right and left branches of both divisions scored higher marks."
- "Better answers avoided the use of clichés such as “rest and digest” to describe the parasympathetic system since the beating heart performs neither of these functions."
- "Candidates who gave correct reasons for the brief latency and rapid decay of vagal stimulation as well as the slow onset and gradual offset of sympathetic stimulation were awarded extra marks."
- "Those who mentioned the different effects of right and left sided stimulation of both divisions on cardiac function were given bonus marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Although both divisions of the autonomic system function in a reciprocal manner, their actions are not merely the opposite of each other. An example is the effect of parasympathetic stimulation on contractility of the heart, which is not due to muscarinic stimulation but to interneuronal interactions at the level of nerve endings."
- "Many candidates spent too much time on unnecessary biochemical details on receptor function."
- "A full discussion of the baroreceptor reflex was not required for a pass in this section."
