title: "Discuss the factors that affect oxygen transport from the alveoli to the tissues."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: ANZCA
year: 2018
sitting: B
question: 02
passRate: 34
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Five topics could earn marks if correctly described and discussed: Oxygen cascade diagram, Alveolar gas equation, Fick’s Law of diffusion, Oxygen flux equation, Haemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most candidates mentioned Fick’s Law and component factors affecting diffusion."
- "There was a large emphasis on time versus perfusion limiting of diffusion and little discussion of the partial pressure gradient driving diffusion."
- "Most candidates mentioned the oxygen flux equation and the components of oxygen content of blood."
- "Around half discussed the haemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve and factors affecting unloading of oxygen in the tissues."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Relatively few candidates described the alveolar gas equation."
- "A small number of candidates correctly mentioned shunt and several candidates incorrectly mentioned alveolar dead space as factors impacting alveolar to arterial partial pressure gradient."
- "No candidate discussed the role of oxygen consumption by mitochondria as the primary motive force for movement of oxygen."
