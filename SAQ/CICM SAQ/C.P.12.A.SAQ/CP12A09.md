title: "Describe the changes to cardiovascular physiology in a healthy elderly person."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2012
sitting: A
question: 9
passRate: 10
EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answer candidates were expected to at least mention the effects on the heart, e.g. increases in size due to concentric ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), hypertrophy of myocytes but a decrease in the number of myocytes, cardiac output decreases, the increase in cardiac output in response to severe exertion is attenuated, ventricular filling is particularly dependent on diastolic relaxation which is impaired, greater contribution of atrial contraction, increase in left ventricular afterload, effects on vasculature, e.g. intima and media thickening result in less distensibility, effects on endothelial function, e.g. nitric oxide release is decreased, effects upon autonomic and integrated responses, e.g. decline in receptor numbers, down regulation of post-receptor signalling and decreased receptor density and impaired baroreceptor reflexes."
EC_extraCredit:
- "It is clearly stipulated in the syllabus that candidates would be expected to understand physiology as it applies at the extremes of age."
- "In the past, questions have been asked relating to foetal and neonatal physiology as well as for the elderly."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This question was poorly answered as candidates lacked a detailed and coherent knowledge of this topic."
