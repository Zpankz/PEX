entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2012
sitting: A
question: 4
passRate: 0
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This included the following - Insulin (acts to up-regulate Na/K ATPase activity promoting intracellular shift of potassium in adipose and muscle tissue); catecholamines (beta2 stimulation up-regulates Na/K ATPase activity promoting intracellular shift of potassium); aldosterone; pH (acidosis promotes H+/K+ exchange (via H+/K+ antiport), and reduces the activity of the Na K ATPase pump); osmolality (cellular dehydration increases intracellular K+ concentration promoting diffusion of potassium out of the cells); exercise; plasma potassium; temperature."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates were required to synthesize knowledge across a number of areas and have a good overview of the topic."
