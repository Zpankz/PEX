title: "Draw (include labels and normal values) a normal spirometry trace in a young adult (20% of marks). Describe the changes seen in the spirometry, and the respiratory system overall, in pregnancy at term (80% of marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2012
sitting: A
question: 13
passRate: 50
EC_extraCredit:
- "This question was generally handled well."
- "Significant variation exists in normal values between textbooks, and examiners took account of this variation."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some candidates failed to provide any normal values or gave values not in accord with the traces they provided."
- "Some candidates confused spirometry (volume/time) with flow volume loops or even a forced expiratory volume trace. These scored no marks."
- "The second part was not well answered by some candidates with failure to describe changes - or even contradicting correctly graphed changes (for example the reduction in residual volume with pregnancy described as increased)."
- "Memorising curves needs to be accompanied by understanding."
- "No marks were awarded for detailed discussion of the Haldane effect, as this was not asked."
- "Candidates are reminded to read and answer the question."
