EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answer candidates were expected to mention that the arterial pressure waveform is made up of many different sine waves (as determined by Fourier Analysis) with each sine wave having a specific frequency."
- "Every system has its own natural oscillatory frequency, or resonant frequency."
- "The pressure measuring system has a resonant frequency at which oscillations occur, and if this is less than 40 Hz, it falls within the range of frequencies present in the blood pressure waveform and oscillations may produce a sine wave which is superimposed on the blood pressure wave form."
- "The resonant frequency can be increased by using a short, wide, stiff catheter."
- "In respect to damping, some damping is inherent in any system and acts to slow down the rate of change of signal between the patient and pressure transducer."
- "Mention of causes of damping and the optimal damping coefficient (0.677) were expected."
- "An under-damped system is one whereby resonance occurs causing the signal to oscillate and overshoot (damping factor <0.7) and an overdamped is one whereby the signal takes a long time to reach equilibrium but will not overshoot."
- "It may not reach equilibrium in time for a true reading to be given (damping factor >1.0)."
- "Both resonance and damping can alter the measured systolic and diastolic values but the mean pressure is not affected"
