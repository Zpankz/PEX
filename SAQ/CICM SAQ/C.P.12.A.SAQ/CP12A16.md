EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates simply listed an abnormality or confused the direction of electrolyte change."
- "Few candidates went beyond hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia and hypochloraemia."
- "Several candidates gave confused answers as to the mechanism(s) or drew pictures of a tubule with directional arrows for electrolytes with inadequate explanation."
- "Some candidates simply ran out of time and wrote very little â€“ this is a pity as a list would have generated marks."
- "Candidates are reminded to practise the exams to time and attempt all questions."
