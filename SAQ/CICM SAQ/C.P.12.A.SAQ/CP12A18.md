title: "Describe the processes of excitation and contraction within a smooth muscle cell (60% of marks). Briefly outline the mechanism by which nitric oxide affects smooth muscle cell activity (40% of marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2012
sitting: A
question: 18
passRate: 20
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to mention mechanisms of muscle cell membrane activation (e.g. Ca2+ channel mediated action potential, Pacemaker potential, etc), sources of rise in intracellular Ca2+, intracellular Ca2+ binding to calmodulin in cytoplasm Ca2+calmodulin complex binding to, and activation of myosin light chain kinase, energy dependent myosin cross bridges and cycling and mechanism of smooth muscle relaxation."
- "Nitric Oxide (NO) activates guanylyl cyclise which in turn catalyzes the dephosphorylation of GTP to cyclicGMP which in turn induces smooth muscle relaxation, and the various mechanisms by which this occurs."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Insufficient breadth and depth of knowledge limited candidatesâ€™ performance to this question."
