passRate: 20
EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answer candidates were expected to mention that the CAC has two main functions: energy production and biosynthesis."
- "Some understanding of the overall reaction ( AcCoA + 3NAD+ + FAD + GDP + Pi + 2H2O  2CO2 + 3NADH + FADH2 + GTP + CoA ), the link between oxidation of metabolic fuel (carbohydrates, lipids and protein) and aerobic energy production (oxidative phosphorylation), that Acetyl CoA is final common product of these oxidations (Glucose via glycolysis (cytoplasm), Free fatty acids via β oxidation (mitochondrial matrix) and Amino acids – glucogenic and ketogenic reactions), that CAC is first stage of aerobic respiration, requires oxygen to proceed, that the CAC together with oxidative phosphorylation accounts for 2/3 to 3/4 of ATP generated from fuel oxidation and anabolic involvement, whereby several biosynthetic pathways utilize CAC intermediates, e.g. Glucose biosynthesis (gluconeogenesis) via malate then oxaloacetate, fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis via citrate + CoA  AcCoA, Amino acid biosynthesis via reductive amination and transamination reactions, Porphyrin (organic component of haeme) via succinyl CoA and Purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis – precursors of nucleotide bases for DNA and RNA."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Only an outline of the importance of the citric acid cycle (CAC) was expected, and not a detailed understanding."
- "Candidates struggled to appreciate its importance."
