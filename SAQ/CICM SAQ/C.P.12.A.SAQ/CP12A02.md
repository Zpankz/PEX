title: "Outline the physiological consequences of therapeutic hypothermia at 32 degrees Celsius"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2012
sitting: A
question: 2
passRate: 0
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A good answer was expected to outline changes in metabolism as well as specific organ responses such as cardiovascular (e.g. bradycardia; vasoconstriction; decreased cardiac output, etc), respiratory (decreased minute volume; haemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve moves left; increased anatomical dead space; diminished HPV; increased pulmonary vascular resistance, etc), renal (e.g. diuresis, changes to GFR, etc) as well as other organs."
EC_extraCredit:
- "It is well documented and often stressed that the Primary Exam is focused upon the basic sciences that underpin clinical Intensive Care."
- "It will examine a candidates understanding of, for example, the physiology associated with a clinical circumstance."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates discussed why we use therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest rather than outline the physiological consequences of hypothermia at 32 degrees Celsius, for which they would not have scored any marks."
- "Again candidates failed to synthesize a coherent and detailed answer."
