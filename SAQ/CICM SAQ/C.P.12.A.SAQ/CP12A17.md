title: "Define afterload and describe the physiological factors that may affect afterload."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2012
sitting: A
question: 17
passRate: 60
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Definitions for afterload vary slightly amongst common physiology textbooks, and candidates were expected to mention any one commonly accepted definition."
- "Essentially afterload is the resistance to ventricular ejection - the \"load\" that the heart must eject blood against and is related to ventricular wall stress (Law of Laplace, T=Pt.r/u)."
- "Candidates were expected to mention aortic valve and systemic vascular resistance, aortic impedance, blood viscosity, intathoracic pressure and relationship of ventricular radius and volume."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates generally did well, but few substantially good answers, with a lack of detail being the biggest limiting factor."
