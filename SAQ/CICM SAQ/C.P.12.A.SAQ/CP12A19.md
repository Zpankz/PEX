title: "Outline the distribution, clearance and physiologic functions of magnesium in the body."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2012
sitting: A
question: 19
passRate: 20
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to mention normal plasma (0.7 – 1.1 mmol/l) and intracellular (20mmol/l) levels, distribution (approximately 50% of total body magnesium is in bone & 20% in skeletal muscles), clearance (almost solely renal, approaches GFR, renal threshold set at just above normal serum Mg concentration, below which get almost complete reabsorption), activity (e.g. co-factor in metabolism), effects on muscles (reduces muscle excitability, inhibits excitation-contraction coupling, reduced contractility / weakness / depressed reflexes), effects on nerves (e.g. reduces nerve excitability, blocks NMDA receptors), systemic and coronary vasodilation and inhibits platelet function."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Insufficient breadth and depth of knowledge limited candidates’ performance to this question."
