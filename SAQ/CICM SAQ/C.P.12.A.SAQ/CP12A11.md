title: "Compare and contrast renal and hepatic blood flow and its regulation"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2012
sitting: A
question: 11
passRate: 70
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to mention values for renal and hepatic flow (total flow, % of cardiac output and oxygen consumption), basic anatomical comparisons, distribution (e.g. renal cortex 95% , renal medulla 5%,), two capillary beds (glomerular and peritubular) for renal, and hepatic triad and sinusoids for the liver, function (filtration for renal blood flow and metabolic activity for hepatic) and regulatory mechanisms for each (e.g. myogenic, autonomic, metabolic and humoral for both and tubuloglomerular feedback for renal)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Generally well done with some very good answers."
- "A tabular format worked well."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Another fundamental physiology topic that required candidates to understand, and synthesize knowledge from multiple areas."
