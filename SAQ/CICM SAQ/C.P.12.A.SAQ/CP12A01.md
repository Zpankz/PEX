entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2012
sitting: A
question: 1
passRate: 0
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to focus on the physiology (including mechanisms) involved with detection of hypoxia (e.g. peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation) as well as response."
- "Examples of response included sympathetic stimulation, the respiratory centre and organ specific (e.g. cardiac, CNS, blood, cellular, etc) responses."
EC_extraCredit:
- "This topic is well covered within a number of fundamental texts, in particular, Nunn’s Respiratory Physiology."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "In general candidates’ answers were not “broad” enough, lacked detail and were too focused on chemoreceptors only."
