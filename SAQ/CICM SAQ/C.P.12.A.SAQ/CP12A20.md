title: "List the physiological factors affecting the diffusion of oxygen across the alveolar membrane (70% of marks). Describe how this changes with exercise (30% of marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2012
sitting: A
question: 20
passRate: 50
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Factors affecting the rate of gas diffusion through the respiratory membrane include those related to the Fick equation (e.g. thickness of the membrane, surface area of the membrane, diffusion coefficient of the gas in the substance of the membrane, partial pressure difference of the gas between the two sides of the membrane, gasâ€™s solubility), rate of combination of oxygen with reduced haemoglobin and factors affecting surface area (e.g. lung volume, age, posture)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The first section of this question was generally well done, but few really good marks, whereas the second section was poorly understood."
- "During strenuous exercise the oxygen diffusion is greatly increased and there is opening up of previously dormant pulmonary capillaries increasing the surface area of blood into which oxygen can diffuse."
- "Also, alveolar ventilation increases and there is better matching of ventilation and perfusion increases from 21ml/min/mmHg up to 65ml/min/mmHg."
