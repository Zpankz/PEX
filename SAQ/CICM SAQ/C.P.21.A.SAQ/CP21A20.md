title: "Outline the physiological factors that influence cerebral blood flow."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2021
sitting: A
question: 20
passRate: 19
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A good answer gave a normal value, iterated that CBF is held relatively constant by autoregulation, and proceeded to divide factors affecting CBF into categories with an explanation/description of each."
- "Those factors with the greatest influence were expected to have more accompanying information (e.g., pressure/myogenic autoregulation, metabolic)."
- "Systemic factors such as MAP, O2, CO2 were expected to be mentioned with detail of the impact (i.e., key values, relationships demonstrated with a description and/or labelled graph)."
- "Local factors within the brain such as H+ concentration/pH, metabolic activity (including the impact of temperature, inclusion of mediators, regional variation based on activity & grey versus white matter) were also expected to be mentioned."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Overall, this question was poorly answered with a high failure rate."
- "Few answers mentioned impact of pH change independently of CO2."
- "Few answers mentioned how CO2 changes the pH of CSF and that over time, this impact is buffered/reduces."
- "The role of the sympathetic nervous system was required to be mentioned although not explored in detail (although many answers overstated the importance of the SNS on CBF or gave a simplistic concept such as increased SNS activity increases CBF)."
- "Many answers focussed on descriptions of the Monro-Kelly doctrine and ICP to the exclusion of the aforementioned factors or included detail on factors influencing MAP which were not required (and irrelevant when within the autoregulation range)."
- "Many answers were simplistic: e.g., increase MAP increase CPP therefore increase CBF, or by stating CO2/O2 without mentioning a relationship or the limits/patterns of the relationship."
- "Many answers failed to separate the effect of systemic PaO2 and PaCO2 from metabolic autoregulation."
