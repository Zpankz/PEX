title: "Outline the formation, structure, and function of the platelet."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2021
sitting: A
question: 03
passRate: 79
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The first section required a brief outline of the formation of platelets from pluripotent stem cells via megakaryocytes."
- "The second section required an outline of platelet structure highlighting the special features such as, an absence of a nucleus, the presence of an external glycocalyx layer, specific surface receptors, contractile proteins, dense tubular system and granules."
- "The third section was about platelet function where the expected focus was on the role of platelets in haemostasis."
- "This required outlining the mechanism of platelet plug formation by adhesion-activation-aggregation, interactions with the coagulation cascade and role of platelets in clot contraction as well as fibroblast invasion."
EC_extraCredit:
- "This question was divided in three sections to help candidates formulate an answer template."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Although many candidates were able to answer the first section reasonably well, there was a noticeable knowledge deficit in the latter two sections."
- "A significant proportion of answers had missing information on platelet structure and lack of structure in outlining platelet function."
