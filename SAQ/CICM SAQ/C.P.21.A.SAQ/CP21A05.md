title: "Outline the factors that determine central venous pressure (60% marks) and explain how it is measured (40% marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2021
sitting: A
question: 05
passRate: 57
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The measurement section should have included an explanation of the components of an invasive pressure monitoring system relevant to the measurement of CVP."
EC_extraCredit:
- "This question examined a core area of cardiac physiology and measurement."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Considering this, candidates overall, scored poorly in this section."
- "There was a common misunderstanding around the relationship between cardiac output and CVP."
- "A decrease in cardiac output (e.g. due to either decreased stroke volume or heart rate) will cause an increase in CVP as blood backs up in the venous circulation, increasing venous volume as less blood moves through to the arterial circulation; the resultant increase in thoracic volume increases central venous pressure."
- "Several candidates confused the direction of their arrows, for example \"increased right atrial compliance increases CVP\"."
- "Double negatives were used by several candidates which then resulted in the incorrect relationship described. (e.g., \"arrow down compliance and arrow down CVP\")."
