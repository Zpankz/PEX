title: "Describe renal handling of potassium (60% marks), including factors that may influence it (40% marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2021
sitting: A
question: 08
passRate: 33
EC_expectedDomains:
- "From an answer template perspective, a \"describe question\" in this context involves both the stating the relevant potassium handling mechanism and then giving a description of how it occurs and how this system is regulated."
EC_extraCredit:
- "This question covers a core physiology topic."
- "The detail required is well described in the recommended reference texts."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Generally, this question was poorly answered."
- "Many answers that scored poorly simply listed sites of potassium handling but excluded the details surrounding the specific receptors and channels involved as well as the processes that exist to perpetuate and regulate these biological processes."
- "Simple identification as to whether the potassium was being secreted or reabsorbed as well as the location as to where this may occur within the nephron, were often not specifically detailed or used interchangeably."
- "Such answers scored poorly."
