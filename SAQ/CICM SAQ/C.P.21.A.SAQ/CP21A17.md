title: "Describe the principles of measurement of arterial haemoglobin O2 saturation using a pulse oximeter (60% marks). Outline the limitations of this technique (40% marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2021
sitting: A
question: 17
passRate: 74
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Nearly all candidates described the Beer-Lambert laws correctly, but few specifically described the basic principles of absorption spectrophotometry."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most candidates provided a reasonable structured sequence of how a pulse oximeter generates a value."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates had a reasonable list of extrinsic factors that can interfere with pulse oximeter performance, but few described the intrinsic/inherent limitations of the device that can cause SpO2 to be different to SaO2, such as functional versus fractional saturation."
