title: "Explain perfusion limited and diffusion limited transfer of gases in the alveolus."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2021
sitting: A
question: 15
passRate: 36
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A description of the components of the Fick equation was expected - and how this related to oxygen and carbon dioxide transfer at the alveolar capillary membrane."
- "Estimates of time taken for each gas to equilibrate relative to the time taken for the RBC to travel across the interface was also expected for full marks."
- "Better answers described CO2 as ventilation limited."
- "Some answers also correctly included the component of interaction with the RBC and haemoglobin."
EC_extraCredit:
- "This question required detail on those factors affecting gas exchange at the level of the alveolus."
- "The rapid rate of equilibration (developed tension) was the limiting factor in of blood/alveolar exchange that rendered some gases perfusion limited (examples - N2O, O2 under usual conditions but not all) and the slower rate of others diffusion limited (examples CO and O2 under extreme conditions e.g., exercise, altitude)."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "CO2 despite rapid equilibration and higher solubility was correctly described as perfusion limited (unless in disease states)."
- "Ventilation/perfusion inequalities over the whole lung were not asked for and scored no marks."
