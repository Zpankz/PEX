title: "Define clearance and hepatic extraction ratio (30% of marks). Describe the role of the liver in drug clearance with examples (70% of marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2019
sitting: B
question: 15
passRate: 70
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Clearance was generally well answered."
- "It is the volume of plasma cleared of a drug per unit time, not the mass of drug cleared."
- "An equation was helpful in identifying the relevant components of hepatic clearance. ClHep=QH X ERHep | ERHep= FU x ClInt / QH + FU x ClInt | QH = hepatic blood flow | ERHep = hepatic extraction ratio | FU = fraction of drug unbound in plasma | ClInt = hepatic enzymatic capacity."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates did not describe the effects of hepatic blood flow and intrinsic clearance on drugs with high and low hepatic extraction ratios."
- "Some discussion of Phase I and II reactions was also expected."
