title: "Describe renal blood flow and its regulation (80% of marks). Outline the impact of adrenoreceptor agonists on renal blood flow (20% of marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2019
sitting: B
question: 02
passRate: 64
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The description of renal flow involves a brief comment of the anatomy including interlobar, arcuate, interlobular arteries, then afferent and efferent arterioles â€“ 2 sets of capillaries and then corresponding veins and better answers made the distinction better cortical and medullary flow and went on to detail the consequence of this."
- "Renal blood flow is autoregulated and most candidates describe well the various mechanisms around myogenic and tubuloglomerular feedback."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were gained with by discussing renal vascular resistance and how this may be varied."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The impact of adrenoreceptor agonists is varied but generally sympathomimetic agents will vasoconstrict and therefore increase renovascular resistance and result in a decrease renal blood flow."
- "The relative impact on afferent vs efferent arteriolar tone may alter glomerular perfusion pressure."
