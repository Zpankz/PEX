entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2019
sitting: B
question: 03
passRate: 41
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Some detail was expected on a general description that tension is variable with the length of muscle."
- "It was expected answers would describe that there is a resting length at which tension developed on stimulation is maximal."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates omitted that differences exist between muscle types with smooth muscle behaving differently."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional credit was given for the distinction about active tension vs resting tension."
- "It was expected a description of the potential mechanism would be included with discussion of sliding filament theory, overlapping fibres and optimal sarcomere length."
- "Some candidates utilised a diagram effectively to convey understanding and more detail was rewarded with additional marks."
