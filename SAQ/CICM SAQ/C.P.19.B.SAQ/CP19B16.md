EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question sought information on the structure (anatomy), function (physiology) and vascular supply of the right and left ventricle."
- "Good answers provided detail in each section e.g. values for ventricular pressure rather than simply stating “high- and low-pressure systems”."
- "Many marks may be gained by a simple anatomical description & labelled PV loop for each ventricle."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates focussed solely on the coronary circulation, to which only a proportion of the marks were allocated."
