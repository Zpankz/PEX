entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2020
sitting: A
question: 4
passRate: 63
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Higher scoring candidates described the counter-current multiplier mechanism, the countercurrent exchanger and the contribution of urea cycling to the medullary osmotic gradient."
- "Detailing the mechanisms as to how they may be established, maintained and or regulated."
- "Values for osmolality at the cortex & medulla and within the different parts of the LOH was required."
- "A description of the countercurrent exchanger system where inflow runs parallel to, counter to and in close proximity to the outflow was expected."
- "This could have been achieved by describing the anatomical layout of the loop of Henle and the vasa recta."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Descriptions of the multiplier (LOH) alone did not constitute a passing score."
