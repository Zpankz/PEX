entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2020
sitting: A
question: 17
passRate: 27
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question asks for a considered response that should focus on context sensitive half-life, compartments and metabolism, instead many focused on the speed of onset and potency, which are minor considerations when drugs are given for long periods by infusion."
- "Better answers also related the above to various relevant pharmacodynamic influences such as age, liver and renal impairment."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates often demonstrated a superficial knowledge of key pharmacokinetic concepts with limited application of these principles in the context of an intravenous infusion."
EC_extraCredit:
- "These are both level 1 drugs commonly used as an infusion in daily practice."
- "This question specifically asked the candidates to frame their answers around an intravenous infusion of fentanyl in comparison to morphine."
- "A tabular listing of general properties of the two drugs highlighting the differences between the drugs would not score well."
