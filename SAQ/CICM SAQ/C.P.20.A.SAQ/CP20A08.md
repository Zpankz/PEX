title: "Describe the production, metabolism and role of lactate."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2020
sitting: A
question: 8
passRate: 16
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Better answers used the categorisation in the question as a structure for their answer."
- "Many candidates gave a good description of lactate production from glycolysis, increasing with accumulation of NADH and pyruvate, when these are unable to enter Krebs cycle."
- "Higher scoring candidates often mentioned non-hypoxic causes of pyruvate accumulation which include; circulating catecholamines, exercise, sepsis or lack or mitochondria (RBCs)."
- "Mention of the relative ATP production of the two fates of pyruvate was also noted in more complete answers."
- "A key role of lactate is the ‘lactate sink’, allowing a period of ongoing ATP production from glycolysis when cells become oxygen deplete or the Kreb’s cycle is inhibited; few candidates detailed or highlighted this."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "There were however, many vague and incorrect descriptions as to what lactate is and its physiological role."
- "Many candidates suggested that its presence is abnormal or pathological."
- "Most answers demonstrated a superficial understanding and physiological detail of lactate’s role as an energy currency in times of oxygen debt."
- "The Cori cycle was generally superficially described."
