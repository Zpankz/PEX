EC_expectedDomains:
- "Most candidates had a structured answer to mechanisms of resistance that covered the major categories (alter target protein, prevent entry, efflux, degrade drug) and provided an example of a bacteria and the affected antibiotic, as was required to answer the question in full."
- "Better answers included a brief outline of class, mechanism of action (action on DNA gyrase to inhibit replication), spectrum (Gram negatives particularly mentioning Pseudomonas, lesser Grampositive cover, not anaerobes, some atypical), PK (with correct dose, wide penetration into tissues including bone/prostate etc., predominantly renal excretion), side effects/toxicity (common or specific to cipro e.g. QT, tendinitis, arthropathy) and an example of resistance."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Ciprofloxacin, whilst perhaps not a first line drug in the ICU, was not well known by many candidates."
