EC_expectedDomains:
- "Marks were awarded for the two components of this question – structure and function."
- "The functional component was handled better – however much time was wasted with detailed drawings of the oxyhemoglobin curve (not many marks awarded for this)."
- "The basic function of haemoglobin carriage of oxygen and carbon dioxide was known, but detail was often missing about its role as a buffer or its role in the metabolism of nitric oxide."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The structure component was often only briefly described with a cursory overview provided; however, this component contributed around half of the available marks."
- "Many candidates were unable to accurately describe the structural components of the haemoglobin molecule."
