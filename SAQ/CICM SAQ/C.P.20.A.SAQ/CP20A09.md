EC_expectedDomains:
- "Answers framed around absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion performed better."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Some brief comments on physiology are required as the basis for pharmacokinetic change, but discussion of physiology that was not then specifically related to pharmacology did not score marks."
