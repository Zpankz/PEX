entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2020
sitting: A
question: 12
passRate: 23
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Descriptions of the clinical effect seen with over / under dampened traces on blood pressure was well described."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates gave detailed answers that involved the set up and components of the arterial line system that was not asked for in the question and did not attract marks."
- "There was confusion around the correct use of the terms natural frequency, resonance frequency and harmonics – candidates that were able to describe these frequencies correctly went on to achieve a good mark – the graphs and discussion around optimal dampening, over and underdamped traces were often drawn poorly or without sufficient detail, and at times were not used within in the context of the answer."
