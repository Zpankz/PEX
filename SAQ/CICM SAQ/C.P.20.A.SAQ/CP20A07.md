title: "Describe the physiological control of systemic vascular resistance (SVR)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2020
sitting: A
question: 7
passRate: 21
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question invited a detailed discussion of the physiological control mechanisms in health, not pathophysiology nor drug-mediated effects."
- "The central and reflex control mechanisms that regulate SVR over time are distinct from the local determinants of SVR."
- "The question asked about systemic vascular resistance and did not require a discussion of individual organs except for a general understanding that local autoregulation versus central neurogenic control predominates in different tissues."
- "Peripheral and central chemoreceptors and low-pressure baroreceptors were relevant to include along with high pressure baroreceptors."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "There was often confusion between dependent and independent variables."
- "Cardiac output is generally depended upon SVR, not vice versa, even though SVR can be mathematically calculated from CO and driving pressures."
- "Emotional state, temperature, pain and pulmonary reflexes were frequently omitted."
