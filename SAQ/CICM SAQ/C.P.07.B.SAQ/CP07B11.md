EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected for a pass were: Definition of hypoxaemia; Physiological causes of hypoxaemia; Formation of a lactic acidosis; Development of hypocarbia secondary to stimulation of respiration from hypoxia and acidosis; Explanation of the decreased bicarbonate concentration and negative base excess"
