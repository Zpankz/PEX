EC_expectedDomains:
- "Second messenger - Hormone/drug - receptor binding is coupled to a subsequent series of intracellular biochemical events that precipitate the ultimate hormone/drug effect."
- "Examples are G proteins an energy dependent process by which there is hydrolysis of G protein-associated GTP to GDP. There are both stimulating and inhibitory proteins which subsequently act to increase or decrease activity of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, resulting in increased levels of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) in the cell which in turn activates protein kinases that phosphorylate various proteins, ion channels, and second messenger enzymes."
- "Also G proteins stimulate hydrolysis of phosphatidyl-inositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) generating inositol- !,â– 4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG). Both systems increase intracellular calcium."
