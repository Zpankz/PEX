title: "Describe the effects of a tachycardia on myocardial oxygen supply and demand in a normal heart."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2007
sitting: B
question: 19
passRate: 29
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected were the determinants of myocardial oxygen supply. These include arterial oxygen content and coronary blood flow. Coronary blood flow depends on coronary perfusion pressure and coronary vascular resistance and that most left coronary blood flow occurs in diastole. Tachycardia reduces diastolic time and hence left coronary blood flow. In comparison blood flow in the right coronary artery is continuous both in systole and diastole and is little affected by heart rate."
- "A description of the determinants of myocardial oxygen demand was also required (e.g. left ventricular, preload, contractility, afterload and tachycardia"
EC_extraCredit:
- "A correctly labelled diagram of left and right coronary blood flow attracted extra marks."
- "Extra marks were given for describing metabolic autoregulation, the high oxygen extraction, explaining that oxygen supply cannot be increased by increasing oxygen extraction in the coronary circulation and describing the driving pressure differences in both coronary arteries in systole and diastole."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Unfortunately most diagrams were inaccurate, not labelled and had no units on the axes."
- "Systolic compression particularly reduces blood supply to the left ventricular subendocardium which is most susceptible to ischaemia."
- "This part of the question was particularly poorly answered."
