- "Ibuprofen - inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) and synthesis of prostaglandins, which are important mediators for peripheral sensitization and hyperalgesia. Act peripherally and spinal COX - non selective. Oral and PR only Associated with a number of side effects, including decreased haemostasis, renal dysfunction, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and effects on bone healing and osteogenesis"
- "Tramadol - is a synthetic opioid that exhibits weak p-agonist activity and inhibits reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline. Analgesic effects primarily through central mechanisms, it may exhibit peripheral local anaesthetic properties."
- "Tramadol is comparable in analgesic efficacy to ibuprofen. Common side effects (overall incidence of 1.6% to 6.1%) include dizziness, drowsiness, sweating, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, and headache. Tramadol should be used with caution in patients with seizures or increased intracranial pressure and in those taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors. IV and oral preparations. No bleeding, GIT and renal complications. More expensive"
- "Both have advantage of lack of respiratory depression, major organ toxicity, and depression of gastrointestinal motility and a low potential for abuse."
