EC_extraCredit:
- "Examples of drugs were well done."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most common omissions were not to further describe how the different mechanisms of action of diuretics increased urine output, e.g. “disruption of the counter current multiplier system by decreasing absorption of ions from the loop of Henle into the medullary interstitium, thereby decreasing the osmolarity of the medullary interstitial fluid”."
- "There was often little mention of increased urine solutes and the effect the electro chemical effect had in promoting a diuresis."
