title: "The binding of a drug (D) to a receptor (R) is illustrated by the following expression: - kon [D][R] <ZZjDR] koff where [D] and [R] are the concentrations of the drug and receptor, respectively, and k is the rate constant for the particular reaction. Using the equation given, explain the following terms: - a) the ratio of koff / kon b) the implications of a low value for the ratio above c) the term affinity d) the clinical implications of a high value for affinity e) two physiological factors that affect the rate constant k"

sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 14
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected for a pass were: The ratio of k off/k on is the dissociation constant; A low value indicates that less drug is required to bind to the receptors; Affinity is the reverse of the dissociation constant; Clinical application of high affinity include large effect at lower concentrations; Physiological factors could include temperature"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The main problem with this question was lack of knowledge."
