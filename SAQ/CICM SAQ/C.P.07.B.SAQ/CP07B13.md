EC_expectedDomains:
- "Main points/concepts expected in answer: Surfactant - increases lung compliance » decreases surface tension at alveolar air - water - interface ■ prevents small alveoli from collapsing ■ accounts for most of hysteresis in intact lung; Lung elastic recoil ■ lung compliance changes in disease states; Lung volume ■ lung compliance greatest around FRC * lung compliance reduced at low and high lung volumes * gravitational effects on regional lung compliance; Pulmonary blood volume * pulmonary venous congestion reduces lung compliance; Lung size - specific compliance - lung compliance / FRC; Dynamic lung compliance ■ influenced by airways resistance * lung compliance measured during normal breathing ■ less than static lung compliance ■ frequency dependence"
