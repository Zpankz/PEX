title: "Describe the autoregulation of renal blood flow."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2007
sitting: B
question: 18
passRate: 43
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To achieve a pass in this question, candidates needed to briefly define autoregulation and state the range of Mean Arterial Pressure over which this occurs, and why it occurs, then provide a more detailed discussion about the mechanisms thought to be responsible for this."
- "The main site of autoregulation in the kidney is the afferent arteriole."
- "There are two main factors that affect vascular tone in the afferent arteriole, these are stretch-activated constriction of vessels (myogenic mechanism) and tubulo-glomerular feedback (TGF)."
- "Both of the above mechanisms are important to maintenance of near-constant blood flow."
- "Stretch results in membrane depolarisation, increased intra-cellular concentrations of calcium ions, and ultimately, vasoconstriction."
- "In tubulo-glomerular feedback, complex signals pass from the macula densa to the afferent arteriole, regulating its tone."
- "The fundamental theme of TGF is that increased delivery of fluid and/or NaCl to the distal tubule causes vasoconstriction, thus limiting the flow (negative feedback)."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The major weakness in answers was again the failure to include sufficient information to achieve a pass mark"
