sitting: B
question: 24
passRate: 0
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points for a pass were: Patient factors: Normal value for the difference between end tidal and arterial CO2; Physiological factors e.g. alveolar dead space, failure to plateau of the capnograph trace; Pathological factors e.g. cardiac arrest, air embolism, asthma; Equipment factors: Leaks; Occlusion; Sampling site errors etc"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A common mistake was to state that dead space caused the difference between end tidal and arterial carbon dioxide but not which type of dead space."
- "The Bohr equation was not required."
