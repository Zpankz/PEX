EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected for a pass included a brief description of the following: The system components; The principles of light absorbance and the Beer-Lambert Law; The differential absorbance of Hb species in red/infrared spectrum, and their use to calculate the amount of reduced and oxygenated Hb present; LED emitting 660/940/off cycles at 450-900Hz, averages data over several cycles to eliminate ambient light, and detect pulsatile and non pulsatile elements; Pulse added absorption of each cycle compared as ratio “R” at different wavelengths; Calibration curve to compare “R” to SaO2 data from healthy volunteers; The limitations of the technique including: quality of product, bias, precision and accuracy, insensitivity to PaO2, false readings and their causes"
