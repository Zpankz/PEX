- "[[D1 2]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected candidates would describe that both these are surrogate measures for Glomerular filtration rate."
- "It was expected candidates could explain that serum creatinine results from a balance of creatinine produced and excreted and hence the slow response time and limitations for its use because of changes in both production and excretion."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Credit was given for clear definitions, formula and normal values (such as plasma clearance is the volume of plasma cleared per unit time)."
- "Extra credit was given for appreciating the non linear relationship between changes in serum creatinine and creatinine clearance and that significant changes in glomerular filtration can occur before this is reflected in the serum creatinine."
- "Comment on the problems of dilution with acute changes in fluid balance and that tubular secretion of creatinine can occur when the serum creatinine concentration is high both gained extra marks."
