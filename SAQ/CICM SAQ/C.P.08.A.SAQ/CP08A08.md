- "[[D1 2f]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main concept required was that the renal excretion of water is basic to the maintenance of constant body water conditions. This renal water excretion is controlled by multiple factors that influence glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption. Also the kidney has mechanisms that allow it to eliminate excess water by excreting a dilute urine or to conserve water by excreting a concentrated urine."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers provided details of the large GFR and the renal tubular handling of water."
- "Extra marks were awarded for details on ADH including its origin, secretion, regulation and mechanism of action and the concept of electrolyte free water clearance."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some candidates confused aquaporins with vasopressin receptors."
- "Other candidates produced long and irrelevant descriptions of the renin angiotensin system which gained no extra marks."
