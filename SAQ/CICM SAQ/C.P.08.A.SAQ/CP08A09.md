EC_expectedDomains:
- "The three main anticonvulsant mechanisms required were: 1. Sodium channel blockers. These promote the inactive state of voltage activated Na channels. Sodium channels are unable to open for a period of time making the neuron more refractory to action potential generation. Rapid repetitive firing is diminished and spread of electrical activity to adjacent brain areas is suppressed. Examples: phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrgine, Na valproate 2. Drugs that enhance GABA mediated synaptic inhibition. This increases the influx of chloride ions into the cell and hyperpolarizes the neuron. 3 mechanisms: a. Act on GABA receptor. Example: benzodiazepines, barbiturates. b. Inhibit GABA transporter and reduce neuronal GABA reuptake. Example: tiagabine. c. Promote GABA release. Example: gabapentin. 3. Drugs that inhibit Calcium channels. Limit activation of voltage activated Ca channel known as the T current. Example.: Na valproate"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Other mechanisms of action with examples if described earned extra marks. These included glutamate /NMDA receptor inhibition. Example: magnesium."
