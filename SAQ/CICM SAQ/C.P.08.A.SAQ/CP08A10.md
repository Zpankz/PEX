exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2008
sitting: A
question: 10
passRate: 33
lo:
- "[[B1h Gas transport in the blood 2a]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points candidates were expected to cover included: A discussion of the non-linear relationship between O2 content and partial pressure and the factors which affect this relationship; Modification of the Fick equation as it relates mixed-venous oxygen to delivery and consumption; The components of delivery should have been described and use of the O2 flux equation would have been helpful."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were available for describing how these might change in physiological and pathological states."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates frequently interchanged content and partial pressure, without clearly displaying how these are related."
- "The O2 flux equation, when included, was often written incorrectly."
- "No consideration was given to normal variations, such as pregnancy or exercise"
