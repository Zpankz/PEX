title: "Draw and label a left ventricular pressure volume loop in a normal adult. List the information that can be obtained from this loop."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2008
sitting: A
question: 24
passRate: 66
lo:
- "[[C1c]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to draw and label a diagram showing the relationship between pressure and volume during the different phases of the left ventricular contraction and relaxation (or systole and diastole)"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good answers to this question consisted of a well-labelled graph with appropriate scale on both x and y-axes showing all the important events during systole and diastole of the left ventricle."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The common omissions were rapid and slow ejection phase during systole, when aortic valve closes, stroke volume, ejection fraction, end-systolic pressure volume line showing the contractility of the left ventricle."
- "Some candidates appeared to have confusion about which line shows contractility and which line shows left ventricular after load."
