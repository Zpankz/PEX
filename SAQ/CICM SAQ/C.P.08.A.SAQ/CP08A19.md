title: "Outline normal impulse generation and conduction in the heart. Describe the features present in a normal heart that prevent generation and conduction of arrhythmias."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2008
sitting: A
question: 19
passRate: 33
lo:
- "[[C1b 2.a, b;]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question required description of the SA node, its primary role and generation of the pacemaker potential and the influence of the autonomic nervous system."
- "A diagram of the conducting pathways, highlighting specialized tissues with fast or slow conduction velocities would have been appropriate."
- "The importance of the AV node in preventing retrograde conduction and high rates conducted to the ventricles (>220 / min) was often neglected in answers."
- "A discussion of the Purkinje Fibres with particular reference to the absolute and relative refractory periods was essential."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for mention of the atrial internodal pathways, conduction within the ventricles from the endocardial to epicardial surfaces and the significance of the compensatory pause in response to ectopic beats."
EC_errorsCommon: []
resources:
- "Cardiovascular Physiology, “Electrical Activity of the Heart” (Chapter 2), Berne and Levy."
