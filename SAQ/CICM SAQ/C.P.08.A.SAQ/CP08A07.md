exam: PEX
college: CICM

- "[[N 2i]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The components of plasma calcium are diffusible Ca ( free and complexed ) and nondiffusible Ca ( protein bound ). Only the plasma free Ca is physiologically active and regulated by homeostatic mechanisms. Plasma free Ca is also affected by plasma pH and albumin concentration."
- "The distribution of Ca in the body and the fact that ECF Ca is less than 0.1% of total body Ca. ECF and hence plasma Ca is the result of a balance between dietary intake, gastrointestinal absorption and excretion, renal excretion and exchange with bone Ca."
- "Tight hormonal regulation of GIT absorption, bone exchange and renal excretion mainly by parathyroid hormone and calcitriol."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were given for mention of other hormones that have a lesser effect on plasma Ca concentration."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "No candidates described the feedback control mechanisms involving PTH and calcitriol."
- "The second part of the question on the mechanism of action of biphosphonates was poorly answered."
