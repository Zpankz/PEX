entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2008
sitting: A
question: 06
passRate: 0
lo:
- "[[B1g]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Range, regional pulmonary differences and gradients of V/Q ratios."
- "Definitions of shunt (V/Q = 0) and dead space (V/Q = )."
- "Explanation of why and how V/Q mismatch lowers arterial PaO2 (majority of pulmonary blood flow being from basal regions, shape of haemoglobin disassociation curve)."
- "Explanation of why and how V/Q mismatch lowers arterial PaCO2 (majority of pulmonary blood flow being from basal regions, predominately linear shape of CO2 disassociation curve within the physiological range of PaCO2 values)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Again, the use of illustrations would be very useful aids as part of a good answer."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates often failed to frame their answer to the question that was asked and deviated to areas not directly sought after by the question. This resulted in wasted time and opportunities for marks."
