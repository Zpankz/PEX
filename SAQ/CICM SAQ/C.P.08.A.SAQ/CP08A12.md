lo:
- "[[C2d 2]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates could use a number of different classifications, however, were required to include all of the major groups of agents."
- "Mechanisms of action required more than listing adrenergic receptor types. Some listing or discussion of the sub-cellular mechanisms was necessary."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Comment about intracellular calcium being the final common end-point would have scored additional marks"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most made some mention of the sympathomimetics, however failed to sub-classify these, or confused catecols versus non-catecols, or naturally occurring versus synthetic agents."
- "Other agents, such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors, calcium sensitisers, cardiac glycosides, or calcium itself received minimal attention."
