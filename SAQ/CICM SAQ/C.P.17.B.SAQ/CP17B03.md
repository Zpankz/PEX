exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2017

question: 3
passRate: 67
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A summary of factors including the role of plasma concentration, protein binding, molecular size and charge was required to pass."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A good place to start was with the correct equation for a filtered load and a description of the components."
- "Better answers described the components and how they differ and change over the glomerulus."
- "Many candidates usefully based answers around the Starling forces."
- "Many answers gave examples for the effects of size and charge and relate endocrine responses to specific alterations in arteriolar tone and how this affected filtration."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A detailed discussion of cardiovascular and endocrine responses to hypovolaemia was not required."
- "Some candidates confused clearance with filtered load."
