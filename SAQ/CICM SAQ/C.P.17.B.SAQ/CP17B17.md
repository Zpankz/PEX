EC_expectedDomains:
- "Concise definitions were required with a clear explanation of the underlying physical principles."
- "The response time of the system, degree of overshoot, effect on amplitude, noise and ability to faithfully reproduce frequencies relative to the natural resonant frequency were important considerations."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates interpreted the question as relating to arterial lines and a detailed discussion of the components and characteristics of an intra-arterial catheter and transducer system did not attract marks."
