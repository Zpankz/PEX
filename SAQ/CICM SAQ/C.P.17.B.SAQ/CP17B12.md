- "For the PK parameters a general description rather than exact values was sufficient (i.e. ‘high protein binding’ rather than ‘98% protein bound’)."
- "It was expected that candidates would mention the fact that clopidogrel is a pro-drug and the factors which influence its conversion to the active form."
