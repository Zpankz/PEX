title: "Explain the mechanisms responsible for the cell resting membrane potential (60% of marks) and describe the Gibbs Donnan effect (40% of marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2017
sitting: B
question: 14
passRate: 35
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Explanation of these factors should have included a detailed description of the selective permeability of the membrane, electrochemical gradients and active transport mechanisms."
- "Answers should demonstrate awareness of the Nernst equation and the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A good answer included a definition of the resting membrane potential and a clear description of the factors that determine it."
- "The better answers included a definition and discussed in detail the influence of non-diffusible ions (intracellular proteins) on the distribution of diffusible ions."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "These were often confused, sometimes with the GibbsDonnan effect."
- "Descriptions of the Gibbs-Donnan effect generally lacked detail and understanding."
