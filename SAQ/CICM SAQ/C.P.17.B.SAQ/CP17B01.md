- "The use of a table ensured all areas were covered including class, indications, pharmaceutics, mode of action, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and adverse effects."
- "Answers should have included a comment on first-pass effect, the significance of the difference in protein binding and the details of metabolism, particularly paracetamol."
- "Knowledge of metabolism at therapeutic doses and the effect of overdose were expected."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The uncertain nature (and possibilities) of the mechanism of action of paracetamol was alluded to in better responses."
- "Better answers included potential interactions with other drugs (e.g. warfarin) and contraindications to the use of these drugs."
