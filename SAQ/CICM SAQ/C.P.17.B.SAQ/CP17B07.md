- "More complete answers included details on the function, anatomy, a description of the pre- and post-ganglionic fibres, ganglia, receptors and neurotransmitters involved."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A table or diagram lent structure to the answer."
- "Candidates may have scored higher if they had provided a little more detail in their answers."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Whilst most commented on ‘fight or flight’ for the SNS and ‘rest and digest’ for the PNS, no candidate observed that the SNS is a diffuse physiological accelerator and that the PNS acts as a local brake."
- "No candidate included the fact that the SNS supplies viscera and skin whilst the PNS only supplies the viscera."
- "Many candidates failed to make reference to the fact that the postganglionic SNS receptor is G protein coupled and the PNS postganglionic receptor is Gcoupled on muscarinic receptors but operates an ion channel when nicotinic."
