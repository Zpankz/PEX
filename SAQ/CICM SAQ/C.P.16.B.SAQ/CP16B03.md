title: "Describe the factors that determine glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the kidney (70% of marks). Outline methods by which GFR can be measured (30% of marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2016
sitting: B
question: 03
passRate: 57
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected candidates would discuss autoregulation of GFR & RBF, tubuloglomerular feedback, and integrated responses the body uses to keep GFR steady."
- "Candidates were expected to outline the methods of GFR estimation."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good answers included a description of Starling forces acting at the glomerular basement membrane."
- "Better responses described the rationale behind the use and limitations."
- "Creatinine clearance, inulin and nuclear medicine techniques all scored marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Confusion about the nature of induced effects on afferent or efferent arteriolar dilation and constriction limited marks for some candidates."
- "Many failed to mention the effects of mesangial surface area, Bowmans space pressure or serum protein content."
- "Some candidates made no attempt at this section and missed the opportunity to score marks."
- "Estimates of CrCl/GFR [eGFR by formulae such as Cockcroft Gault, and serum Cr] are not measurement of GFR."
