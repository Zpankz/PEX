entityType: SAQ

college: CICM

sitting: B
question: 14
passRate: 33
EC_extraCredit:
- "This question was best answered by considering form and then function."
- "A complete answer would mention the3 shunts that come off the anaerobic glycolytic pathway (RBC’s only means of ATP generation), namely the production of 2-3 DPG via the RapoportLuebering shunt, generation of NADPH by the hexose monophosphate shunt (protects RBC from oxidative damage) and the reduction of metHb back to Hb by way of the NADH."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many answers lacked sufficient information to pass this question."
- "Many answers included lengthy discussions about the production of RBC’s, the Oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve or calculated the oxygen content of blood."
- "RBC metabolic adaptations (e.g. 2, 3-DPG, NADPH production by the HMP shunt/ G6phosphatase to regenerate glutathione and metHb reductase) were rarely mentioned, as were vasodilatory mediators released by RBCs."
