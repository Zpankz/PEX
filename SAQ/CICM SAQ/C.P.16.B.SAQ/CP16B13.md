title: "Outline the anatomy and physiology of liver blood flow (60% of marks). Explain the changes to drug metabolism when liver blood flow decreases (40% of marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2016
sitting: B
question: 13
passRate: 55
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Discussion was then expected to revolve around how the liver blood flow is controlled."
- "The second part of the question required recognition that hepatic clearance is the product of hepatic blood flow and the hepatic extraction ratio and considering the impact on drugs with a high or a low extraction ratio."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A statement regarding the quantum of hepatic blood flow with recognition of the contributions made by the Hepatic Artery and Portal Vein, drainage into the sinusoids before entering the hepatic vein which drains into the IVC would have been a good start."
- "Answering this with respect to intrinsic and extrinsic factors along with an understanding of the semi-reciprocal relationship between hepatic arterial and portal venous blood flow would have rounded out a good answer to the first part of the question."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many answers failed to adequately mention how hepatic blood flow was controlled/regulated thus limiting the marks available."
- "Similarly, in the second part of the question, many candidates spent considerable time mentioning the principals of drug metabolism rather than focusing on the question asked."
- "The concept of hepatic drug clearance as the product of blood flow and its extraction ratio was poorly appreciated."
