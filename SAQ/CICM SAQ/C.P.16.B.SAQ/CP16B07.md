EC_expectedDomains:
- "An integrated answer to supply and demand of oxygen was expected, as a comparison between the right and left ventricles."
- "It was expected answers would comment on the phasic nature of coronary blood flow which differs between left and right and the consequence of this to subendocardial oxygen supply during systole usually."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers noted that oxygen supply can only be increased to cope with increased demand only by increased coronary blood flow."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates concentrated on differences not similarities."
- "Myocardial oxygen demand was in general poorly described."
