title: "Outline the physiological factors that affect the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide within the lung."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2016
sitting: B
question: 22
passRate: 43
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good answers to this question were those that included a definition of diffusion; an outline of Fickâ€™s Law of Diffusion and then a further description how each of the variables in the this Law affect the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lung; and an outline of the other factors that affect diffusion not covered by the above."
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Most candidates included Fick's Law in their answers and at least briefly expanded on the associated variables."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Few candidates defined the process of diffusion."
- "The other common omissions were the factors that affect diffusion that aren't directly encompassed in Fick's Law, such as cardiac output, capillary transit time, carbonic anhydrase (conversion of HCO 3 to CO 2 ) and combination of oxygen with haemoglobin."
