title: "Outline the distribution of calcium in normal plasma (20% of marks). Describe the hormonal control of the calcium concentration in the plasma (80% of marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2016
sitting: B
question: 01
passRate: 53
EC_expectedDomains:
- "As stated in the question, the distribution in plasma (not body) was expected."
- "It was expected that candidates were able to identify the roles of parathormone (PTH), 1,25 OH vitamin D and calcitonin as the major hormonal regulators."
- "Candidates are reminded to include units [mmol/l]."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers were able to describe the physiology and integration of these hormones at the gut, kidney and bone."
- "Calcitonin and its transient and (probable) minor opposite role were also identified in these answers."
- "Better answers were also able to identify the permissive roles of growth hormone, cortisol and thyroxine."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates spent considerable effort describing the roles of calcium and particularly its role in excitation contraction coupling â€“ which was not asked and hence scored no marks."
