EC_expectedDomains:
- "Pressure in a system is generated by the interaction between flow and resistance."
- "A structured approach to defining and describing the many factors that influence fluid flow and resistance was required to score well."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Poiseuilleâ€™s law describes the determinants of resistance to laminar fluid flow and provides a useful answer structure."
- "It is also necessary to describe factors that determine flow. This includes factors that determine venous return, as well right and left heart output."
- "A standard structured answer to the pharmacology of nitric oxide enabled concise and high scoring answering of this question."
