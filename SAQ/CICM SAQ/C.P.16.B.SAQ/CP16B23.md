entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2016
sitting: B
question: 23
passRate: 8
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To pass this question each of the three components needed to be compared and contrasted for both agents."
EC_extraCredit:
- "In spectrum of activity, as well as what important organisms the agents were effective against, marks were also given for the important organisms that they were not effective against (e.g. MRSA and beta-lactamase producing organisms for penicillin G; and aspergillus for fluconazole)."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some answers included information that could not gain marks, as it was not directly relevant to the question asked (e.g. presentation and dose)."
- "For example, a common omission either in mechanism of action or in adverse effects was that fluconazole inhibits microsomal P450 enzymes."
- "Some candidates confused fluoroquinalone with fluconazole."
