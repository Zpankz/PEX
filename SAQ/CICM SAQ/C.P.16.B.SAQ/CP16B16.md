EC_extraCredit:
- "However, the good candidates also mentioned effects on the foetus due to ion trapping caused by the more acidic foetal blood."
EC_expectedDomains:

EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates forgot to include effect on epidural administration of drugs in pregnancy caused by engorged epidural veins during labour."
- "Candidates lost marks for omitting the effect of increased cardiac output on the rate of distribution of IV drugs to effector sites, the effect of increased hepatic blood flow on drugs with high intrinsic clearance, the increased clearance of drugs with renal clearance due to increased GFR & renal plasma flow."
