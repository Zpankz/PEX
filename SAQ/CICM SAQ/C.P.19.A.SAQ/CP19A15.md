entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2019
sitting: A
question: 15
passRate: 49
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A brief description of its structure, roles of glycine and magnesium, ions conducted, result of activation, role in memory and learning and agonists/antagonists was expected."
- "Pharmacodynamics were generally well covered including CVS (direct and indirect effects), CNS (anaesthesia, analgesia, amnesia, delirium, effects on CBF and ICP) respiratory (bronchodilator with preservation of airway reflexes) GIT effects (salivation, N and V)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Administration routes and doses scored marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Detail on structure and functions of the receptor were a common omission. Knowledge of specific pharmacokinetic parameters was less well covered, including low oral bioavailability and protein binding and active metabolite"
