- "Better answers had a structure with headings such as function, formation, circulation, absorption and composition with dot point facts under each heading. The second part of the question lent itself to a diagram with labelling which scored well. Precise surface anatomy and mentioning all layers from the skin to the sub-arachnoid space scored well."
