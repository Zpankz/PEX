title: "Compare and contrast the measurement (40% of marks) and interpretation (60% of marks) of both central venous and mixed venous oxygen saturations."
entityType: SAQ

sitting: A
question: 8
passRate: 8
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers quoted the modified Fick equation and related this to cardiac output and factors affecting oxygen consumption versus delivery."
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Methods of measurement such as co-oximetry and reflectance spectrophotometry needed to be explained. Marks were awarded for the normal values. Discussion of the relationship between ScvO2 and SmvO2 and changes during shock attracted marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates did not appreciate that ScvO2 refers to SVC / RA junction venous oximetry and not femoral or peripheral venous oximetry."
