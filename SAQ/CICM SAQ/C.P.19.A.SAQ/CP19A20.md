title: "Describe the cardiovascular effects of positive pressure ventilation on a patient who has received a long acting muscle relaxant."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2019
sitting: A
question: 20
passRate: 33
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Structured answers separating effects of positive pressure on right and left ventricle, on preload and on afterload were expected."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Overall there was a lack of depth and many candidates referred to pathological states such as the failing heart. Simply stating that positive pressure ventilation reduced right ventricular venous return and/or left ventricular afterload, without some additional explanation was not sufficient to achieve a pass level."
