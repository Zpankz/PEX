EC_expectedDomains:
- "Useful headings included preparation and administration, dose, indications and adverse effects. Not many candidates knew the dose of FFP, and few were able to describe the preparation/production of the product. Few candidates knew the factors available from either product."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Very few answers included details on prothrombin complex concentrate which meant it was difficult to score well. Commonly missed was the need for ABO typing for FFP and that Prothrombin complex concentrate did not require this."
