title: "Outline the sequence of haemostatic events after injury to a blood vessel wall (50% of marks). Discuss the role of naturally occurring anticoagulants in preventing clot formation in-vivo (50% of marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2019
sitting: A
question: 10
passRate: 40
EC_expectedDomains:
- "An explanation of the interaction of these naturally occurring anticoagulants was expected. The clotting factors that are specifically inhibited was expected as part of the discussion."
EC_extraCredit:
- "This question was best answered in a chronological manner. The glycocalyx and vessel wall also plays a role in preventing coagulation."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates omitted initial vasoconstriction and its mechanism. The platelet plug and formation of the clot should have been described followed by the fate of the clot, including in-growth of fibroblasts. Strictly, fibrinolysis is a system for repairing / limiting clot propagation after the fact. Anticoagulants refer to antithrombin III, heparin, thrombomodulin and protein C and S."
