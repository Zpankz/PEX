EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected that answers include sections on the blood supply, the nephron (including the difference between the cortical and juxta-medullary nephrons) and innervation."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A number of candidates failed to quantify renal blood flow and to define autoregulation. The concept that it’s the flow that’s regulated was not described by some. Tubuloglomerular feedback was generally described correctly but a reasonable number had the blood flow increasing when an increased sodium was sensed at the macula densa."
