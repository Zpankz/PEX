EC_expectedDomains:
- "Physiology of the adrenal gland includes an outline of the adrenal medulla, the types of chromaffin cells, hormones secreted and how secretion is stimulated. The three zones of the adrenal cortex should have been outlined including substances secreted, their function and again how their secretion is stimulated. The actions of aldosterone should have been described."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Lack of breadth and detail were in many of the answers. A comment on sodium and water excretion was insufficient to attain many marks for this section. The extra-renal actions of aldosterone were missing from most answers."
