EC_expectedDomains:
- "Definition of innate immunity: present at birth, non-adaptive, responds to a limited set of foreign molecules."
- "Contrast with adaptive immunity: requirement for sensitisation/pre-exposure, potential to respond to many unique antigens."
- "Outline of physiochemical components (e.g., skin, mucus, cilia, gastric acid) and their role."
- "Outline of humoral components (e.g., complement, lysozymes, acute phase proteins) and their role."
- "Outline of cellular components (e.g., neutrophils, macrophages/monocytes, mast cells, natural killer cells) and their role."
EC_errorsCommon: []
EC_extraCredit:
- "Explaining how each physiochemical component acts to prevent infection (e.g., skin as a physical barrier)."
- "For humoral elements, providing a detailed description of their role in immunity, including their sites of production."
