title: "(a) Describe the structure of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), including the location of receptors and enzymes (a diagram may assist in your answer but is not required to achieve full marks) (30% of marks). (b) Explain the events that occur at the NMJ that lead to the onset and offset of a muscle/motor end plate action potential (a description of excitation/contraction coupling is NOT required) (70% of marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2025
sitting: A
question: 14
passRate: 76
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Structure of the NMJ, including all key functional elements (presynaptic terminal, synaptic cleft, postsynaptic membrane, receptors, enzymes)."
- "A clear and ordered explanation of events from the arrival of a presynaptic action potential to the restoration of the resting membrane potential in the postsynaptic motor endplate."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Ceasing the description after acetylcholine binding and degradation, omitting the final steps of returning the motor end plate to its resting state."
- "Confusion between skeletal and cardiac myocyte action potentials."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Using a diagram to assist the description of the NMJ structure."
