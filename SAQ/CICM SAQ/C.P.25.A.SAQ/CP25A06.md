title: "(a) With respect to red blood cell production, outline the following: (i) the site (10% of marks). (ii) the stimuli (5% of marks). (iii) the process (15% of marks). (b) With respect to red cell breakdown, outline the following; (i) the usual lifespan in neonates and adults (10% of marks). (ii) the process of red cell aging, degradation and clearance (40% of marks). (iii) the process of haemoglobin breakdown (20% of marks)."

EC_expectedDomains:
- "RBC Production: site, stimuli, and process of erythropoiesis."
- "RBC Breakdown: lifespan in neonates and adults, process of aging, degradation, and clearance pathways."
- "Haemoglobin Breakdown: process of heme breakdown into iron and biliverdin, and a description of the fate of each component."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Including information on the structure-function relationship of red cells, which was not required."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Including details such as different sites of production in the fetus, duration of erythropoiesis (7 days), changes in aging red blood cells, and different clearance pathways (haemolysis vs. phagocytosis)."
