title: "(a) Define receptors and provide a brief outline of their classification. (20% of marks). (b) Define the following terms and outline the receptor-drug binding and activation characteristics of each: (i) Agonists (20% of marks). (ii) Partial agonists (20% of marks). (iii) Inverse agonists (20% of marks). (iv) Antagonists (20% of marks)."

EC_expectedDomains:
- "Definition of receptors as proteins/glycoproteins on cell membranes, intracellular organelles, or in the cytosol/nucleus, which bind a ligand to cause a conformational change and response."
- "Classification of receptors into 3 classes based on mechanism of action: altered ion permeability, production of intermediate messengers, and regulation of gene transcription."
- "Application of the two-state receptor theory (active and inactive states) to explain drug action."
- "Agonists stabilise the receptor in the active state."
- "Partial agonists occupy the binding site but do not completely favour the active state."
- "Inverse agonists stabilise the receptor in the inactive state."
- "Antagonists block the binding site, preventing agonist binding."
- "Description of the affinity and intrinsic activity for each drug class."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Providing excessive detail on different receptor types or downstream messages, which was not required."
