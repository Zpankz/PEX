title: "(a) Define the interthreshold range of body temperature and the thermoneutral zone and provide the normal values (25% of marks). (b) Explain how the body detects (25% of marks) and defends (50% of marks) against cold exposure, including why neonates and the elderly may be more vulnerable to hypothermia."

passRate: 76
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Clear definitions of interthreshold range (ITR) and thermoneutral zone (TNZ), relating each to the body and environment respectively."
- "Explanation of the sensor-controller-effector mechanism for thermoregulation."
- "Effector responses to cold: mechanisms to reduce heat loss (e.g., vasomotor changes) and mechanisms to generate heat (e.g., shivering, non-shivering thermogenesis)."
- "Explanation of how each component of the defense mechanism may be impaired in neonates and the elderly."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Omission of normal values for ITR and TNZ."
- "Discussing the response to warm environments or the physiological consequences of hypothermia, which was not required."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Discussion of other mechanisms such as behavioral responses."
- "Relating explanations of vulnerability in neonates/elderly to the concepts of ITR and TNZ."
