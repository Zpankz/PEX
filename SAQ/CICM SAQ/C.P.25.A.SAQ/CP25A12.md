EC_expectedDomains:
- "Structure: general features (single cell layer, thin) and specific types (fenestrated, non-fenestrated, sinusoidal)."
- "Mechanism: water movement primarily via ultrafiltration."
- "Forces (Starling forces): a structured description of hydrostatic pressure, oncotic pressure, net-filtration pressure, and the filtration coefficient."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Omission of the effect of arterial and venous tone on capillary hydrostatic pressure."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Discussion of the contribution of the Gibbs-Donnan effect to plasma oncotic pressure."
- "Discussion of the glycocalyx and its influence on fluid movement."
