title: "(a) Define closing capacity (10% of marks). (b) With respect to closing capacity, describe the following: (i) the physiological factors that alter it (30% of marks). (ii) the clinical significance (30% of marks). (iii) ONE method of measurement (30% of marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2025
sitting: A
question: 2
passRate: 34
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Definition of closing capacity."
- "Physiological factors: age (decreases from birth to 16, then increases), high expiratory flow rates, increased expiratory effort."
- "Clinical significance: increased VQ mismatch and PaO2 reduction due to air-trapping, reduced compliance, cyclical atelectasis (lung injury), slower de-nitrogenation, and increased work of breathing."
- "Measurement technique: single breath nitrogen washout test, where closing capacity is the point at which nitrogen concentration rises above the alveolar plateau in phase III."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates struggled with the breadth of effects required for clinical significance."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A discussion of the age at which closing capacity typically exceeds FRC in the supine and upright positions."
