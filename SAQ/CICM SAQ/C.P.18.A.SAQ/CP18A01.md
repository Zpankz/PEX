EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected that answers include the equation for oxygen delivery, a brief description of the components of that equation and the normal value."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers divided oxygen carriage into that bound to haemoglobin and that carried in the dissolved form. A reasonable amount of detail on the haemoglobin structure and its binding of oxygen was expected, including an explanation of co-operative binding and the oxygen carrying capacity of haemoglobin. Better answers mentioned Henryâ€™s law in the description of dissolved oxygen, along with an estimation of the amount of oxygen that is normally in the dissolved form."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A large number of candidates omitted the equation for oxygen delivery, a brief description of the components of that equation and the normal value."
