EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates confused co-oximetry with other methods of measuring oxygenation of blood. Whilst there were a number of excellent descriptions of pulse oximetry, these attracted no marks for the first two sections. Structuring the answer based on the three parts asked, would have improved answers ensuring all aspects of the question were addressed."
