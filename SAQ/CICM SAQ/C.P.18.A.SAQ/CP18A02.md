EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers included: the mechanisms of action, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, indications for use and adverse effects. To complete the answer, the two drugs should have been compared and contrasted. There are many areas which could be contrasted e.g. different indications, different mechanisms of action, different half-lives and duration of action, different metabolism and different pharmacodynamic effects, in particular the effects on the cardiovascular system and the pulmonary circulation. Similarities should also have been highlighted."
