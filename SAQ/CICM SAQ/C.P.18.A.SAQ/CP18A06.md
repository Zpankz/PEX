entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2018
sitting: A
question: 06

EC_expectedDomains:
- "The three main buffers in blood should have been described: bicarbonate system, haemoglobin and proteins. The pKa, the buffering mechanism and the capacity of the system should have been described."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Marks were only awarded for buffers in blood."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Few candidates defined a buffer making it difficult to award 25% of the marks for this question. The Henderson Hasselbach equation was sometimes incorrect. Some candidates described non-blood buffers."
