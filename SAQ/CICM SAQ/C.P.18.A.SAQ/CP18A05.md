- "Well-constructed answers were presented in a table to compare pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics with a separate paragraph to discuss the concept of context sensitive halftime. Important pharmacokinetic points included: the differences in lipid solubility, ionised fractions and onset, and differences in metabolism. Marks were awarded for a definition of context-sensitive half-time. A discussion of these two drugsâ€™ context-sensitive half-times should have included the differences in re-distribution into other compartments and rates of elimination."
