EC_expectedDomains:
- "An outline of anatomical, alveolar and physiological dead space was expected."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Fowlerâ€™s method was generally well described."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some candidates failed to provide a correct definition of dead space. The Bohr equation was commonly incorrect, and many did not comment on how to measure the components of the Bohr equation. Some plotted the axes incorrectly. The impact of increased dead space was not often well explained. Very few people stated the major impact of increased dead space is reduced minute ventilation and how this would affect CO2."
