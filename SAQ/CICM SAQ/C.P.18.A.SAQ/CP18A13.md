EC_extraCredit:
- "Most candidates recognised that flow may be laminar, turbulent or transitional. Most accurately recounted Reynolds number and applied this correctly. Additionally, the Poiseuille equation was correctly stated by most candidates and correctly related to laminar flow. Few candidates recalled the equation describing turbulent flow."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Whilst most candidates defined density correctly, there was a lot of uncertainty regarding viscosity."
