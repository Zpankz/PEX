EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected that candidates would follow a standard pharmacology format and discuss pharmaceutics, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and adverse drug reactions. Both of these drugs are ‘Level A’ in the syllabus and a suitable level of detail was expected. It was expected candidates would discuss in detail the mechanism of action, electrolyte and acid-base effects."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The use of a table assisted with both clarity and the ability to compare the two drugs."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Writing separate essays about each makes it difficult to score well. Pharmacokinetic values were poorly answered. Qualitative terms such as ‘moderate, good and some’ are vague and should be avoided. Only correct numerical values (or ranges) attracted full marks."
