EC_extraCredit:
- "A single concise sentence for each attracted full marks. Some candidates drew diagrams & equations, which added few marks. Tonicity was best defined as the number of ‘effective’ osmols (those that cannot cross the cell membrane) in a solution relative to plasma. The use of a table greatly facilitated the comparison of 0.9% saline and 5% dextrose solutions. Some manufacturers state calculated values and some approximate values on the bags – both were accepted."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates gave an adequate definition of osmolality and tonicity. Some candidates confused osmolarity (mOsm/L) and osmolality (mOsm/kg). Values for composition, osmolarity and osmolality were poorly done. No candidate correctly pointed out the fluids respectively have 9g NaCl and 50g dextrose per litre."
