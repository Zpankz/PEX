EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates exhibited a structural approach with reasonable understanding of the pharmacology of atropine although there was a lack of precision (anticholinergic is correct, competitive muscarinic antagonist is more precise)."
- "Some answers did not contrast glycopyrrolate adequately."
- "The phrase ‘hepatic metabolism, renal excretion’ needed to be accompanied with detail if marks were to be awarded."
