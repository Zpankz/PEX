EC_errorsCommon:
- "Moderately well answered overall, however many candidates lacked a systematic approach to their comparison of the pharmacology of drugs that alter the pH of gastric fluid."
- "Few candidates discussed pharmacokinetics in sufficient detail, with only a very limited discussion comparing the absorption, metabolism and elimination of even common drugs."
- "Relevant information such as bioavailability, duration of effect, and available formulations with dosing was often lacking."
- "Similarly, little attention was given to important drug interactions."
- "Many candidates included drugs which are used for gastric problems or mucosal protection, but do not specifically influence gastric pH e.g. sucrulfate."
- "Some candidates gave unnecessarily detailed accounts of the physiology of gastric fluid production and the acid-base mechanisms involved."
- "All candidates provided details of H2 blockers and PPIs, but often did not list representative examples or compare the effects on basal versus stimulated acid secretion."
- "Many candidates also discussed antacids, but did not indicate their mechanisms of action properly and did not outline potential adverse effects."
- "Some candidates included prostaglandin analogues and anticholinergic drugs for completeness and were able to indicate their roles in affecting gastric acid secretion."
