title: "Relate the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) to the events of the cardiac cycle (60% of marks). Briefly describe the mechanism of the effects of digoxin, and the mechanism of the effects of amiodarone, on the ECG (40% of marks)"

- "[[Cib2c]]"
- "[[C2c2b]]"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were awarded for diagrams relating the ECG accurately to pressure events during the cardiac cycle."
- "For example, better answers noted that AV conduction was depressed by Digoxin, predominantly due to an increase in Vagal tone"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to provide sufficient detail in answers."
- "Time intervals, units of measurement and clear labels were essential for diagrams."
- "Mechanisms pertaining to ion flux and ion channels needed to be specifically explained."
- "Discussion of mechanisms needed to be accurate and relevant to the effect on the ECG."
