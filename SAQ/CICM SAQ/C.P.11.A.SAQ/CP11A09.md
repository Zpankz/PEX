title: "Describe how the kidney maintains the medullary concentration gradient."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2011
sitting: A
question: 09
passRate: 33
lo:
- "[[Section D1]]"
- "[[2c]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A useful introduction could include a definition of medullary concentration gradient and its function."
- "The answer was expected to describe the roles of sodium, chloride and urea in the countercurrent multiplier and the features of the vasa recta countercurrent exchange system."
- "The 3 main areas that needed to be addressed to pass this question included: [1] The loops of Henle with their water permeable descending limbs and water impermeable ascending limbs, which actively remove solutes from the tubular lumen. The counter current multiplier system. [2] The vasa recta which run parallel to the loops of Henle and are permeable to water and solute and have low flow. This allows the medullary concentration gradient to be maintained. The counter current exchange mechanism. [3] The role of urea which is concentrated in the medulla by mechanisms which involve changes in permeability to urea in different regions of the tubules partly influenced by the effects of antidiuretic hormone."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some candidates elected to draw the loop of Henle and vasa recta together with the movement of various solutes and water and answer the question from it. Unfortunately mistakes in these diagrams only confused their answers further."
