entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM

sitting: A
question: 12

- "[[S2c]]"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers included a description of the Fick Principle and the fact that it is based on the law of conservation of matter."
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Also required were an accurate description of the technique, a description of the indicator-time curve and errors encountered in the technique."
- "For thermodilution these included the requirement for a Swan Ganz catheter, nature and temperature of the injectate, temperature measurement using a thermistor in the pulmonary artery and an appreciation that it is the curve of a decrease in temperature versus time that is being analysed."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates chose to describe the thermodilution technique of cardiac output measurement. Descriptions of other techniques and indicators such as dye dilution using indocyanine green were acceptable alternatives."
