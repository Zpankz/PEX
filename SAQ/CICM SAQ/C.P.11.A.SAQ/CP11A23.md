EC_extraCredit:
- "The benefits of adhering to a well-organised system of columns showing direct comparisons of the various relevant drug characteristics was clear, with candidates who chose this approach covering most of the necessary information in a clear and comprehensive manner."
- "Some candidates managed to provide a great deal of relevant detail within the allocated time as would be expected in this relatively uncomplicated question."
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A straightforward question that was reasonably answered, with most candidates using a methodical tabular approach to explaining the differences in pharmacology between noradrenaline and vasopressin."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Simple definitions were often lacking and failing to provide this basic introductory information resulted in lower marks for this question."
- "While most candidates were able to discuss the effects of each drug on the cardiovascular system, not as many were able to give outline other physiological effects in sufficient detail. For example, many candidates made little mention of important renal, metabolic and haematological effects."
- "While some candidates discussed pharmacokinetics well, many provided only a very superficial outline of this aspect."
- "The important area of adverse reactions could also have been covered in greater detail."
