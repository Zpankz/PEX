title: "Briefly describe the cardiovascular events that occur during ventricular diastole."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2011
sitting: A
question: 21
passRate: 8
lo:
- "[[C1b, 2d,e]]"
- "[[C1c, 2e,f]]"
EC_extraCredit:
- "The better answers included a description of the ionic events that occurred at the various stages of diastole."
EC_expectedDomains:
- "One possible way to answer this question is to offer a definition of the diastolic period then to split the events up for description into mechanical events, ECG events and electrical/ionic events."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Few candidates defined the diastolic period, and whilst many talked about opening and closing of valves, there was generally a poor understanding of the sequence of events whereby the left ventricle comes to be filled with blood."
- "Many answers lacked any reference to the ECG events in diastole."
- "The major weakness in answers was again the failure to include sufficient information to achieve a pass mark. This was probably as a result of the lack of a systematic approach when answering a question of this nature."
