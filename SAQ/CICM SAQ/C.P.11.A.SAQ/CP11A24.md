EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question required candidates to describe the physical principles of blood flow through a dialysis circuit and the movement of solute across a dialysis membrane."
- "A short discussion proceeding to flesh out the factors that determine blood viscosity, circuit pressures and practical examples was expected."
- "Most candidates were able to describe the physical chemistry involved in diffusion across a semipermeable membrane in basic terms, however few provided sufficient details of these important principles."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "While most candidates were able to allude to important factors contributing to the flow of a fluid through a hollow tube, few did so in a systematic way and only some provided relevant formulae showing the relationship between pressure, fluid viscosity and tube resistance."
- "Some candidates discussed convective processes extensively, which was not required in this question focussed on dialysis."
- "Very few candidates went on to properly discuss electrochemical forces affecting solute and water movement across a membrane or the factors that influence the performance of dialytic therapies in practical application."
