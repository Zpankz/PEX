title: "Explain the role of haemoglobin as a buffer"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2011
sitting: A
question: 19
passRate: 33
lo:
- "[[B1h, 2c, 2b]]"
- "[[Section F]]"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional credit was given for an understanding that histidine contains an imidazole group and how these groups are effective as a buffer."
- "brief review of how CO2 is buffered, the role of haemoglobin histidine residues, buffering capacity of oxy haemoglobin and deoxy haemoglobin and how this contributes to the Haldane effect would have rounded out a very good answer."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Few candidates mentioned that haemoglobin was quantitatively significant and no candidate mentioned that it is the primary buffer for CO2."
- "Many answers were quite brief and did not explore the subject matter asked."
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To pass this question, the candidate only needed to define a buffer (weakly ionised acid or base in equilibrium with its full ionised salt), what it does, then discuss how Haemoglobin functions in this capacity."
