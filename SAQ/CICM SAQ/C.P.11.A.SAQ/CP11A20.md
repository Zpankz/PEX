- "[[M2i]]"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates failed to adequately describe the nature of the primary and the secondary response to antigen exposure."
- "Many answers simply did not include sufficient information to achieve a pass mark."
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Providing a statement about what vaccines do followed by some detail about the processes involved in triggering a response and the nature of that response in both Innate immunity and acquired immunity would have achieved a good pass."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The fact that previous immunisation enabled a brisk secondary response was recognised by most candidates but that this was largely due to the proliferation of IgG antibody producing B lymphocytes and effector T cells was not appreciated."
