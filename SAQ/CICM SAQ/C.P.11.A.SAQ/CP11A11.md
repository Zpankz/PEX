- "[[Generic Pharmacology III 2d]]"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Answers framed around the structure of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion performed better."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "An approach based on the physiologic changes of pregnancy performed less well because important areas of pharmacokinetics were omitted."
- "The effects of pregnancy on oral absorption should have included a discussion of gastrointestinal motility, nausea and vomiting and gut blood flow."
- "Absorption from sites other than the gastrointestinal tract, such as skin, lung and the epidural space and the effect of pregnancy on these should have been mentioned."
- "Many answers were vague on the effects of increases in total body water and plasma volume and cardiac output and changes in plasma protein binding on the distribution of drugs."
- "Most answers did not provide enough specific examples."
- "The effect of pregnancy hormones on liver enzyme activity were mentioned by few."
