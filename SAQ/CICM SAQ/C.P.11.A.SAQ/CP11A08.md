title: "Describe the factors that affect the output of the right ventricle"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2011
sitting: A
question: 08
passRate: 50
lo:
- "[[C1c]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "An approach that covered the main determinants of right ventricular cardiac output including heart rate, right ventricular preload, contractility, afterload and the relationship with left ventricular output, ventricular interdependence, and the respiratory system would have provided the framework for a good answer."
- "The observation that the right ventricle is relatively thin walled and its output is very sensitive to changes in right ventricular preload and afterload particularly was central to this question."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some candidates used this approach but described more features of left ventricular than right ventricular output."
- "The unique shape of the right ventricle and its contraction characteristics involving ventricular interdependence were rarely mentioned."
- "Also details on right ventricular afterload and the importance of factors affecting pulmonary vascular resistance were lacking in most answers."
