EC_errorsCommon:
- "The first part of the question on bactericidal activity of gentamicin was better answered than the second part on its toxicity."
- "Details on the cellular mechanisms of bactericidal action and toxicity were lacking in most answers."
- "Most candidates did not appreciate that gentamicin is avidly accumulated and retained by proximal renal tubular cells in concentrations many times higher than the plasma concentration. Also these high tubular cell concentrations of gentamicin are maintained long after the plasma concentrations have fallen to very low levels, thus enhancing its toxic effects. Gentamicin has multiple toxic effects within the tubular cell including adverse effects on protein synthesis, translation and folding, impairment of mitochondrial function and production of reactive oxygen species and damage to the nucleus."
