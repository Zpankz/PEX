lo:
- "[[B2a]]"
- "[[B2c]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected that candidates would outline and describe the mechanism behind the changes in PaO2 in arterial and mixed venous blood, shift in CO2 ventilation, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction as well as pulmonary toxic effects"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates focused on the toxic effects of oxygen, which were often incorrect (CNS symptoms will not occur at one atmosphere)."
- "Candidates simply lacked knowledge, those that did have some understanding failed to provide adequate detail (ie. it was occasionally mentioned oxygen stores are increased but not the mechanism by which or extent to which stores are increased)."
