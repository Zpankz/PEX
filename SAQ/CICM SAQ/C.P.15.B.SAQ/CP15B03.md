EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected candidates would describe the salient features of the anatomy, distribution and content of blood flow and influences on each circulation."
- "Answers with a clear organisation and context for the normal influences of blood flow on the functioning of each organ system scored highly."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Figures should be clearly and accurately labelled to score well."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Anatomy was often sufficiently covered, but candidates often did not take advantage of that by linking the anatomical features to the functional concepts."
- "Many answers failed to demonstrate a depth of understanding of key concepts. For example tubuloglomerular feedback, relationship between hepatic arterial and portal venous flows and autoregulation within both those systems was often poorly described."
