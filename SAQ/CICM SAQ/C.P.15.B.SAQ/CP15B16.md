title: "Describe ammonia metabolism and excretion (70% of marks). Outline the pharmacology of lactulose (30% of marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2015
sitting: B
question: 16
passRate: 37
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected candidates would identify sources of ammonia (colon from metabolism of proteins, kidney, small amounts from breakdown of red blood cells and metabolism in muscles)."
- "The liver converts all circulating ammonia to urea (the urea cycle) (2NH3+CO2 = urea +H2O)."
- "Urea then undergoes enterohepatic circulation (25%) or is excreted by kidneys (75%)."
- "Ammonia (NH3) is lipid soluble and diffuses into the interstitial cell and tubular fluid by non-ionic diffusion where is buffers H+ to become non diffusible NH4+."
- "Lactulose is a non absorbable synthetic, non-digestible disaccharide."
- "It is an osmotic laxative fermented by gut flora producing metabolites (such as acetate) which have osmotic and peristalsis-stimulating effects, and methane causing in flatulence."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "No candidate mentioned enterohepatic circulation and most answers had very little detail on the metabolism and excretion and lacked depth."
- "Few could describe how lactulose decrease absorption of ammonia and a surprising number of people did not even state that lactulose was an osmotic laxative."
