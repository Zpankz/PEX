sitting: B
question: 02

EC_expectedDomains:
- "A well organised answer would provide details on domains of physiology, pharmacology and “other”, such as patient centred effects."
- "Providing a definition of “mild” was often overlooked but doing so assisted a focused answer."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Few answers mentioned pharmacology."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many answers spread beyond “mild” hypothermia or address the “causes” rather than the consequence – neither of which gained marks as they were not answering the question asked."
