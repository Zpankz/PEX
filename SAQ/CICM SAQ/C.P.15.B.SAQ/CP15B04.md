college: CICM
year: 2015
sitting: B
question: 04
passRate: 25
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question requested a definition AND a description of measurement (one method if correctly discussed could and did generate a pass mark)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "additional marks were awarded if multiple measurement methods were mentioned or described."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Detailed descriptions of the factors effecting FRC and its functions were NOT requested and scored no marks."
- "\"Fowlers method\" uses 100% oxygen and nitrogen analysis to calculate anatomical dead space - NOT FRC - so scored no marks."
- "Both Helium dilution and nitrogen washout (with 100%oxygen) enable calculation of FRC using C1V1=C2V2 where V2 = V1+FRC."
- "Body plethysmography requires more complex calculations of P1V1= P2V2 (Boyles Law) applied twice = for the box and then the lung."
- "Few candidates had a clear understanding of this method."
- "Most answers did not demonstrate the depth of understanding of the measurement techniques that was required to score highly."
