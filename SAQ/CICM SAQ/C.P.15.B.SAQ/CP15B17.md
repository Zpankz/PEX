EC_extraCredit:
- "Any reasonable classification was awarded marks."
- "Understanding types of data allows appropriate description and comparison with parametric or non-parametric statistics and better answers highlighted this."
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Standard textbooks well describe this topic, often in their opening chapter."
- "Broadly, qualitative (defined by some characteristic) vs and quantitative (measured on some numerical scale) data exists."
- "These can also be described as categorical or numerical with subdivisions including ordinal, interval and ratio scales."
- "Numerical data may be described as discrete or continuous."
- "Appropriate examples and descriptions of each were required."
- "For example: Categorical data when each individual can only belong to one of a number of distinct categories of the variable: 1. Nominal – categories not ordered but simply have a name e.g. blood group (A,B, AB, O) and marital status (married, single, widowed) 2. Ordinal – categories are ordered in some way e.g. disease staging (advanced, moderate, mild) or degree of pain (severe, moderate, mild, none) Numerical data: 1. Discrete – when the variable can only take certain whole numerical values e.g. the number of visits to GP in last year, or the number of episodes of illness. 2. Continuous – when there is no limitation on the values that the variable can take e.g. weight or height."
