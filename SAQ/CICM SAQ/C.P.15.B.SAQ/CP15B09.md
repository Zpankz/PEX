passRate: 19
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to be detail the principles required to measure carbon dioxide in expired gas."
- "This would involve some comment on ways to sample end tidal gas (in line vs side stream) and also ways to measure carbon dioxide."
- "It was expected candidates could provide a detailed description of infrared analysis including the apparatus design and principles such as the asymmetric nature of CO2 as a polyatomic gas allowing absorption if infrared radiation with some discussion of response times and equipment design."
- "It was expected these principles would be related to the potential errors (e.g. other gases, collision broadening)."
