EC_expectedDomains:
- "The most comprehensive answers were those structured as sensor-controller-effector with an explanation of each part and how homeostasis was maintained."
- "A description of central control was required, rather than listing nuclei or areas."
EC_errorsCommon:

- "Many failed to address all three components of a control question and focused primarily on the sensors."
- "Many answers were just too brief and did not present enough information to demonstrate understanding."
