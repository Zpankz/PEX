title: "Describe the formation and the metabolic fate of lactate. Outline its role in energy production."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2015
sitting: B
question: 06
passRate: 21
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected that the answer would include comments on lactate generation from glucose via pyruvate and the metabolic linkage of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)."
- "Lactate regenerates NAD+ (pyruvate is reduced to lactate while NADH is oxidized to NAD+ )."
- "The citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain occur in the mitochondria of cells, and will only proceed in the presence of oxygen."
- "One molecule of glucose produces 2 ATP anaerobically (pyruvate to lactate) vs 26 aerobically (pyruvate enters TCA cycle) .Total production is about 1500 mmols/day with blood levels resting value of 1–1.5 mmol/L to a peak of 10–15 mmol/L."
- "Lactate can be used in 3 ways: 1. Conversion to glucose via gluconeogenesis in the liver and release back into circulation (Cori cycle). This is the fate of 80 % circulating lactate from tissues low in oxygen (e.g. exercising muscle with low pO2) or red blood cells (no mitochondria). The production from glucose in RBC’s is the Embden-Meyerhoff pathway. 2. Consumed as a fuel e.g. heart (20% of circulating lactate) 3. Mitochondria and oxygen Oxidation back to pyruvate by well-oxygenated muscle cells, heart cells, and brain cells pyruvate is then directly used to fuel the Krebs cycle (generating 28 mmols ATP)"
- "Lactate generation from muscle is increased with B1 mediated stimulation e.g. from adrenaline."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers described the normal generation of lactate in some tissues (e.g. RBC) and role of muscle and liver in metabolism back to glucose (Cori cycle) and the role of lactate as a metabolic substrate in some organs."
- "Marks were awarded for normal production values and blood levels."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates showed some understanding of the role of glucose in the production of pyruvate to lactate."
- "However, the differential ATP production, the role of NADH availability and how oxygen and the role of mitochondria were involved was less well handled."
