title: "Define cardiac preload and describe its determinants."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2015
sitting: B
question: 15
passRate: 29
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question required synthesis and application of knowledge derived from multiple sources rather than regurgitation of a published list in a text."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates failed to recognise that venous return is not the only determinant of preload."
- "Most candidates failed to discuss determinants of venous return."
- "Factors such as contractility, afterload or chamber filling and emptying can all impact preload."
- "In addition to listing determinants the question required an explanation of their relationship with preload (e.g. the direction of change)."
- "A discussion about the determinants of cardiac output was not asked for as did not score marks."
