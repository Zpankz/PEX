title: "Describe the fibrinolytic pathway and identify areas of interaction with the coagulation pathway (80% of marks). List two anti-fibrinolytic agents and state their specific mechanism of action (20% of marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2015
sitting: B
question: 19
passRate: 8
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The fibrinolytic pathway is a cascade largely made up of proteolytic enzmes and other factors synthesized in the liver that circulate in inactive precursor forms."
- "Marks were awarded for description of the principal members of the cascade and the pathway relations between them."
- "Endothelium is also important in the fibrinolytic pathway."
- "Regulation of the pathway to localise the site and size of clot as well as delayed onset of action of fibrinolysis is central to any description."
- "Regulation of fibrinolysis by the coagulation cascade and a description of this area of interaction were expected."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates provided a reasonable description of the fibrinolytic cascade."
- "Marks were not awarded for description of the coagulation cascade that did not have relevance to fibrinolysis."
- "Understanding of regulation of fibrinolysis and itâ€™s interaction with coagulation was poorly answered."
- "Few were able to describe mechanism of action."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most candidates were able to name two antifibrinolytic agents."
