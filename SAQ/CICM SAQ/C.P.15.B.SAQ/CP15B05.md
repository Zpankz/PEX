title: "Explain the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve and the factors that may alter it."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2015
sitting: B
question: 05
passRate: 77
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Marks were awarded for an appropriate curve with values, an explanation of the nature of positive cooperatively and notes on those factors causing changes in the p50 or \"shifts‚Äù in the curve."
- "Most candidates were able to provide the required sigmoid shaped curve with appropriate key value points (p50, venous and arterial points)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better candidates were able to identify p50 as a measure of avidity or affinity for oxygen and commented on T- Tense and R- Relaxed states, the role and production of 2,3 DPG , binding to the beta chains (nature of the lack effect on foetal haemoglobin)."
- "Describing the mechanisms associated with factors shifting the curve and commenting on changes in oxygen content over the steep and flatter parts of the curves gained additional marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates are reminded to answer the question asked - no marks were awarded for a description of dissolved oxygen delivery."
- "Some answers confused the Bohr and Haldane effects."
