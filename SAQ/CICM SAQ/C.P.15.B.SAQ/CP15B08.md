title: "Compare and contrast the physiological changes in the cardiovascular system in pregnancy at term and morbid obesity (BMI > 30)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2015
sitting: B
question: 08
passRate: 2
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question was very specific for the cardiovascular system and therefore answers that described respiratory changes and airway modulation failed to score marks."
- "This answer leant itself to a tabular format."
- "Candidates are reminded to ensure they document the facts in the correct column i.e. obesity facts in the obesity column."
- "The cardiovascular changes associated with term pregnancy are well described in various texts."
- "Those associated with morbid obesity required some integration from various sources and would include a structured series of comments such as heart rate (unchanged), blood pressure (tendency for hypertension), stoke volume (increased), cardiac output (increased), blood volume (increased â€“ although perhaps decreased on a ml/kg basis), systolic function (preserved or increased), LV wall thickness increased."
EC_extraCredit:
- "better answers identified this."
- "Morbid obesity has a specific definition and stating this aided focus of the answers."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The pathological changes seen with the diseases associated with obesity are difficult to tease out"
