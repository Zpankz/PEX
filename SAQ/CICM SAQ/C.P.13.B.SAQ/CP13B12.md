title: "Explain the following laws: Dalton’s, Boyles, Henry’s, Graham’s, Fick’s Law of Diffusion"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2013
sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 26
EC_expectedDomains: []
EC_extraCredit:
- "All the equations and relationship are straightforward so this question provided a good opportunity to score marks."
- "The universal gas laws form the basis of oxygen therapy and delivery, pressure and volumetric monitoring as well as a key to understanding the solubility of gases in blood."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Unfortunately many candidates were aware of the properties of the ideal gases but not the named laws."
- "This led many candidates to omit major sections of the answer and thus scored no marks."
- "Several candidates wasted time with complicated diagrams as well as equations and descriptions (scoring no additional marks)."
- "Many candidates were unable to identify Grahams Law (rate of diffusion inversely proportional to the square root of the molecular weight) but included it in an expanded Fick’s Equation."
