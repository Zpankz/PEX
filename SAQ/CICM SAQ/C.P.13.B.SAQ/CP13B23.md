title: "What factors affect airway resistance? (80% of marks) Briefly outline how it may be measured and/or changes in flow are detected. (20% of marks)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2013
sitting: B
question: 23
passRate: 19
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected candidates could identify that issues around the nature of flow (turbulent vs. laminar) and airway diameter were central determinants."
- "It was expected candidates would describe the determinants of turbulent flow."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The provision of formula and comments about Reynolds number helped demonstrate an understanding of this."
- "Better answers discussed the transitional point in the airway and the paradox about size vs. total cross sectional area and its influence on total resistance."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This topic required a definition and understanding of airways resistance."
- "Several candidates confused pulmonary vascular resistance with airways resistance."
- "Using graphs to help illustrate certain concepts would have been helpful."
- "Measurement of resistance (indirectly via measurement of flow and pressure difference by a body plethysmography, spirometry) and detection of flow (spirometry, capnography) was in general poorly understood."
