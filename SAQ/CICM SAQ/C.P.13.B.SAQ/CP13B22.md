entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2013
sitting: B
question: 22
passRate: 41
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected candidates could provide some detail about the major features along this pathway including a description of sensors, nerve types, spinal cord input and decussation with subsequent projection to higher centres."
- "The question also required a description of the physiology with some discussion of the mediators involved and explanation of how a stimulus or tissue may result in the perception of pain."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers provided additional details about modulation and descending pathways."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common omissions included insufficient detail of the pain pathway and limited or no discussion of the physiological components."
- "The pain pathways following arterial line insertion involve sensing the stimulus and transmitting the sensation to the central nervous system."
