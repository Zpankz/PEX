EC_expectedDomains:
- "For questions asking to outline a particular topic, a general overview of the topic is expected and not merely a “dot-point” list of the functions of the liver without actually delving into the way the liver does those functions."
- "Candidates were expected to list, and provide an overview for each, function of the liver."
EC_extraCredit:
- "This question was generally well answered with a good response being in some structured format, e.g. a mention, followed by a description for each function of the liver."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "In general candidates should avoid making broad-brush statements, which do not get them any marks like “the Liver is the major organ in the body”."
