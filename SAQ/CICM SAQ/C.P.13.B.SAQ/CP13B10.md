EC_extraCredit: []
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This question provided candidates with a clear structure and headings that were often ignored."
- "Candidates wasted time on pharmaceutics, derivation (“foxglove” mentioned often) and dosing – these were not requested and scored no marks."
- "Superficial answers such as “cardiac glycoside” or “calcium sensitiser” were not adequate."
- "Responses such as “modest” for Vd are inadequate – marks could be gained for identifying at least the direction of the difference between the two agents."
- "Likewise “hepatic metabolism and renal excretion” is inadequate."
- "Both agents had quantitative and qualitative differences in outcome of metabolic products and the renal elimination of active drug."
- "Confusing diagrams with inadequate labelling, arrows with two heads and the use of uncommon abbreviations without definition all served to confuse the examiners rather than help the candidate."
