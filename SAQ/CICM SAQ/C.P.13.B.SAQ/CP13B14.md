EC_errorsCommon:
- "In general candidates either lacked a depth of knowledge, or a deep enough understanding of the drugs so as to apply their knowledge specifically to the central nervous system (CNS)."

- "Mention of the non-CNS effects of morphine and tramadol, was not expected, did not score marks, and would have wasted valuable exam time."
