title: "Describe the various rapidly acting cardiac reflexes that influence cardiac function and the mechanisms by which they act."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2013
sitting: B
question: 02
passRate: 22
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected candidates would include within their answer a mention of the stimulus and how it is sensed, the reflex arc and the resultant effect."
- "Candidates could have mentioned the Baroreceptor Reflex/Carotid Sinus Reflex, Chemoreceptor, Bainbridge, Cushing, Oculocardiac and Bezold-Jarisch (involves response to ventricular stimuli, sensed by receptors within the LV wall that trigger vagal afferent type C fibers and the resultant triad of hypotension, bradycardia, and coronary artery dilatation) reflexes."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Cardiac reflexes are fast-acting reflex loops between the heart and central nervous system that contribute to regulation of cardiac function and maintenance of physiologic homeostasis."
