title: "Describe the relationship between creatinine clearance and serum creatinine. (60% of marks) What are the limitations in using serum creatinine to assess renal function in the critically ill? (40% of marks)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2013
sitting: B
question: 11
passRate: 15
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Most candidates were able to describe the Fick equation as it related to clearance, and then relate it to Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better candidates were able to relate the graph to functional nephron loss and hence serum creatinine."
- "This was a straightforward question of core CICM material."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Formula relating GFR to serum creatinine were often quoted incorrectly, graphs poorly constructed and/or labelled and many answers were very superficially answered."
- "The non-linear relationship between nephron mass (and function) and the serum creatinine was poorly appreciated by many."
- "The nature of the variability of creatinine production with age, sex, ethnicity etc. was often omitted, as were the factors involved in the variability in an ICU patient."
