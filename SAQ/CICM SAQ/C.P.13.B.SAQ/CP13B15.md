- "In addition candidates were expected to describe those aspects of the skin that play a role in physical protection, immune, sensory, thermoregulatory and water regulation."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The skin is the largest organ of the body, accounting for about 15% of the total adult body weight, with a rich, but tightly regulated blood flow."
- "It performs many vital functions, including the protection against external physical, chemical, and biologic threats, the prevention of excess water loss from the body and thermoregulation."
- "It is composed of three principle layers, the epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous tissue, each with their own purpose."
EC_errorsCommon:
