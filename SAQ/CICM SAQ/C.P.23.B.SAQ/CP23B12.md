title: "(a) List the effects of stimulation of adrenoreceptors on target organs and tissues (60% marks). (b) Describe the mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of metoprolol (40% marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 74
EC_expectedDomains:
- "effects of the stimulation of adrenoreceptors"
- "mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics only"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Using a systems based structure with a subdivision into each receptor (or vice versa) meant that important GIT, GUT, endocrine and metabolic effects were not omitted."
- "breadth particularly within cardiovascular effects. Venoconstriction, dromotropy and lusitropic effects should also be covered."
- "elaborate on the downstream effects of blocking the beta adrenergic receptors as compared with the information required in the first part of the question"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This question required a list of effects of the stimulation of adrenoreceptors, thus detailed description of downstream effects and exact mechanisms was not required."
- "The second part of the question required a detailed description of the mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics only, thus dose, pharmaceutics and pharmacodynamic information was not required."
