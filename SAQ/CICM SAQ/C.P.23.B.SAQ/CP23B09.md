sitting: B
question: 09
passRate: 20
EC_expectedDomains:
- "classification, structure and distribution of the opioid receptors"
- "intracellular events following opioid receptor activation"
EC_extraCredit:
- "classification most commonly used for opioid receptors (μ(MOP), δ(DOP), k(KOP) & NOP) and a description of the important characteristics or differences between them"
- "central and peripheral distribution including specific central nervous system sites such as pre and post synaptic locations in the brain (ie. the periaqueductal gray, locus ceruleus and amygdala) and spinal cord (ie. primary afferent neurons in the dorsal horn)"
- "presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitters of primary afferent neurons such as noradrenaline and substance P, and postsynaptic inhibition of membrane depolarization of dorsal horn nociceptive neurons"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The classification most commonly used for opioid receptors (μ(MOP), δ(DOP), k(KOP) & NOP) and a description of the important characteristics or differences between them was expected."
- "A description of their central and peripheral distribution was required including specific central nervous system sites such as pre and post synaptic locations in the brain (ie. the periaqueductal gray, locus ceruleus and amygdala) and spinal cord (ie. primary afferent neurons in the dorsal horn)."
- "Opioid receptors as a class are transmembrane spanning G protein receptors that have significant downstream effects including presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitters of primary afferent neurons such as noradrenaline and substance P, and postsynaptic inhibition of membrane depolarization of dorsal horn nociceptive neurons."
