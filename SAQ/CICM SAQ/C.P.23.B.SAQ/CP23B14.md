EC_expectedDomains:
- "physiological factors that alter CBF"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Autoregulation via the myogenic and metabolic mechanisms, the difference between grey and white matter due to metabolic variation, the role of pCO2 and O2, sympathetic nervous system and temperature"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Cerebral Blood Flow is result of CPP/CVR."
