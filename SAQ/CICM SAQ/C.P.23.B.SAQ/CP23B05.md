EC_expectedDomains:
- "details of carbohydrate and lipid stores"
- "metabolic responses to starvation"
EC_extraCredit:
- "anatomical locations, biochemical forms, average amount of energy stored"
- "major sources of energy production, associated biochemical processes and their transition from one process to another or one source to another over time, and the hormonal influences that govern this"
- "organ specific energy utilisation under a starved state"
- "transition of glycogenolysis to gluconeogenesis to ketogenesis"
- "initial protein conservation strategy transitions to eventual protein catabolism"
- "muscle glycogen, an important store of glucose is unavailable to maintain blood glucose concentrations in starvation"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Under the metabolic responses to starvation, a detailed description was expected of major sources of energy production, associated biochemical processes and their transition from one process to another or one source to another over time, and the hormonal influences that govern this."
