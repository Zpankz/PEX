title: "Describe the components and function of the complement system including the role, activation and control?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 15
passRate: 8
EC_expectedDomains:
- "components of the complement system"
- "role, activation and regulatory mechanisms"
EC_extraCredit:
- "number and type of molecule highlighting the important combinations of complement to produce the membrane attack complex"
- "role in the innate immune response against bacterial infections including opsonisation, phagocytosis, chemotaxis, mast cell/basophil activiation, lysis of cells and clearance of immune complexes"
- "3 pathways of activation; classic, alternate and lectin pathyway, with some detail regarding the downstream effect of each that would take into account for the amplication of the response"
- "cessation of complement response is largely due to the limitatations of the half lives of the particular complement glycol-proteins or presence of specific inactivators"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Based on the question stem answers should have been structured to address the components of the complement system as well as the role, activation and regulatory mechanisms."
