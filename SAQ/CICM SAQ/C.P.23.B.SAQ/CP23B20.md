EC_expectedDomains:
- "vagus nerve anatomy"
- "Pre and post-ganglionic physiology"
EC_extraCredit:
- "description of the fibers it carries (visceral, parasympathetic and somatic sensory fibres) and then origin and course from the parasympathetic, sensory and motor nuclei in the medulla as the tenth cranial nerve to its branches; the pharyngeal, cardiac, pulmonary and laryngeal branches"
- "detailed description of the Muscarinic Ach receptor and events. This would also include the 5 subtypes of the muscarinic receptor, with the locations and downstream effects of the M1-M3 locations being the most important to note"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The vagus nerve anatomy was best broken down into a description of the fibers it carries (visceral, parasympathetic and somatic sensory fibres) and then origin and course from the parasympathetic, sensory and motor nuclei in the medulla as the tenth cranial nerve to its branches; the pharyngeal, cardiac, pulmonary and laryngeal branches."
