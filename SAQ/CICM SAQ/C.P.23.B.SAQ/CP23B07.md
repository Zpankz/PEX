entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 07
passRate: 38
EC_expectedDomains:
- "mechanism of action"
- "dose"
- "PK"
- "PD"
EC_extraCredit:
- "detailed description of its alpha agonism 200:1 affinity for alpha 2 over alpha 1 including the classification of these receptors and the downstream effects"
- "Correct dose and/or dose ranges for oral and intravenous formulation particularly for different indications for the prescription of clonidine"
- "absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination characteristics, with enough detail to demonstrate an understanding"
- "significant cardiovascular, neurological and the relative absence of respiratory effects that make it desirable for use as a sedative/co-analgesic in ICU practice"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The mechanism of action required a detailed description of its alpha agonism 200:1 affinity for alpha 2 over alpha 1 including the classification of these receptors and the downstream effects."
- "Pharmacokinetic details expected the absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination characteristics, with enough detail to demonstrate an understanding."
- "Pharmacodynamic marking was weighted towards the significant cardiovascular, neurological and the relative absence of respiratory effects that make it desirable for use as a sedative/co-analgesic in ICU practice."
