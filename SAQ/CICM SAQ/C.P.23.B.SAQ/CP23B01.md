title: "Explain why the oxygen-haemoglobin saturation value derived by a pulse oximeter (SpO2) could be different from the measured arterial value (SaO2)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 01
passRate: 32
EC_expectedDomains:
- "intrinsic and extrinsic factors of potential sources of difference of the SpO2 measurement"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Intrinsic factors included wavelengths used, pulse added absorbance, derivation of the SpO2 value and time delays."
- "Extrinsic factors where largely patient and environment related including light pollution, poor peripheral perfusion for various reasons, probe location variances and probe artefact."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This question required candidates to identify that the measured arterial value (SaO2) was the gold standard to which the limitations of the pulse oximeter should be compared."
