question: 13
passRate: 36
EC_expectedDomains:
- "distribution"
- "clearance"
- "physiologic functions"
EC_extraCredit:
- "intracellular vs extracellular concentrations, the spread amongst organ systems and state of ionisation and protein binding"
- "accurate description of its renal filtration and sites and proportion of reabsorption and secretion along the nephron"
- "regulatory factors and factors that influence this clearance should also be outlined. This included; Mg plasma concentrations, other cations, ECF volume and PTH"
- "role as a cofactor of metabolism and enzyme systems with some examples, the role and mechanism in the musculoskeletal system as a calcium antagonist and inhibitory action in the nervous system including the action against Ach, nerves and NMDA activity"
