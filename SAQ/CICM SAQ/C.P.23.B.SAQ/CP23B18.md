entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 18
passRate: 17
EC_expectedDomains:
- "components and chemical properties of each solution (including pH and calculated and measured osmolarity)"
- "mechanistic description of the different acid base effects"
- "advantages and disadvantages of each fluid"
EC_extraCredit:
- "calcium in Hartmann's risks causing precipitation when mixed with certain drugs and blood products"
- "situations where one fluid might be preferred over the other (for example saline to treat dehydration and metabolic alkalosis secondary to gastric losses – as in a pyloric obstruction)"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This question asked for a comprehensive description of the components and chemical properties of each solution (including pH and calculated and measured osmolarity)."
- "Marks were also allocated for the advantages and disadvantages of each fluid (for example the calcium in Hartmann's risks causing precipitation when mixed with certain drugs and blood products)."
- "Lastly, it was expected that answers would provide situations where one fluid might be preferred over the other (for example saline to treat dehydration and metabolic alkalosis secondary to gastric losses – as in a pyloric obstruction)."
