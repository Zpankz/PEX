title: "Describe the mechanism of action, dose, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of aminophylline."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 11
passRate: 21
EC_expectedDomains:
- "mechanisms of action of aminophylline"
- "pharmacokinetic concepts"
- "pharacodynamic consequences on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems"
EC_extraCredit:
- "PDE inhibition and the down stream pathway and its adenosine antagonist and anti-inflammatory actions"
- "hepatic metabolism with saturable kinetics and thus a narrow therapeutic window/index requiring need for drug monitoring and the risk of metabolic interactions with accelerated or reduced metabolism from inducers or inhibitors of the main enzyme (CYP1A2)"
- "neurological, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal consequences of toxicity"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This question required a detailed description of the many mechanisms of action of aminophylline."
- "Important pharmacokinetic concepts included hepatic metabolism with saturable kinetics and thus a narrow therapeutic window/index requiring need for drug monitoring and the risk of metabolic interactions with accelerated or reduced metabolism from inducers or inhibitors of the main enzyme (CYP1A2)."
- "Detailed pharacodynamic consequences on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems were prioritised as well as highlighting the neurological, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal consequences of toxicity."
