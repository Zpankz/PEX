title: "(a) Outline the impact of sedative agents on thermoregulation (40% marks). (b) Describe the physiological effects of a low body temperature (60% marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 66
EC_expectedDomains:
- "impact of sedatives on the interthreshold range"
- "physiological effects of a low body temperature"
EC_extraCredit:
- "explanation of what this is, how heat is lost, how heat generation is impaired and the mechanism by which these occur (ie. radiation/conduction/convection via vasodilation, with absence of vasoconstriction/heat generation strategies)"
- "systems based approach with an outline of the perturbation as a result of the low body temperature"
- "Temperature thresholds for certain physiological effects ie. loss of consciousness or arrhythmia"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The first part of the question required candidates to outline the impact of sedatives on the interthreshold range with an explanation of what this is, how heat is lost, how heat generation is impaired and the mechanism by which these occur (ie. radiation/conduction/convection via vasodilation, with absence of vasoconstriction/heat generation strategies)."
- "The second part of the question required a systems based approach with an outline of the perturbation as a result of the low body temperature."
