EC_errorsCommon:
- "Pharmacology questions largely have a standardised structure to follow; pharmaceutics, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics."
- "However compare and contrast questions require answering in a way that highlights important similarities and differences between the drugs chosen and the impact of these differences when administered."
- "Whilst these are both diuretics they have very different renal and non-renal effects and thus very different metabolic and electrolyte disturbances."
