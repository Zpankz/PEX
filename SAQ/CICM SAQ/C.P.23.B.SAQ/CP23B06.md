title: "Explain perfusion limited and diffusion limited transfer of gases in the alveolus."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 06
passRate: 48
EC_expectedDomains:
- "factors that influence perfusion and diffusion"
- "behaviour of specific gases including perfusion limited oxygen and carbon dioxide and diffusion limited carbon monoxide"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Factors influencing perfusion include flow/cardiac output, resistance (radius and length) and viscosity whereas diffusion is influenced by the characteristics of the gas (MW and solubility), surface area of diffusing surface and the pressure/concentration gradient."
- "Perfusion and/or diffusion limited characteristics of different gases included how quickly if at all equilibrium is reached and why this occurs with each specific gas."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This question required an explanation of the factors that influence perfusion and diffusion and a detailed description of the behaviour of specific gases including perfusion limited oxygen and carbon dioxide and diffusion limited carbon monoxide."
