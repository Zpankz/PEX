title: "(a) Classify the mechanisms of action of anti-convulsant drugs (30% marks). (b) Outline the pharmacology of gabapentin (70% marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 04
passRate: 21
EC_expectedDomains:
- "mechanism of action of anti epileptic drugs"
- "overview of gabapentin pharmacology"
EC_extraCredit:
- "GABA potentiation (Barbiturates/Tiaganbine)"
- "reduction in excitory transmission (including NMDA/AMPA antagonists)"
- "modification of ionic conductances (sodium channel blockade-Phenytoin, Calcium channel blockade-Lamotrigine, Gabapentin, activation of potassium channels- Retigabine)"
- "multiple proposed mechanisms of action including Ca+ antagonism, inhibited glutamate release and anatagonism and increased GABA concentrations"
- "Important pharmacokinetic properties included dose dependent absorption, minimal protein binding, no metabolism with renal clearance and requirement for dose reduction in renal failure."
- "It has largely central neurological side effects with a rare but important association with steven johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The first part of this question required candidates to correlate the mechanism of action of anti epileptic drugs with atleast one example under each section."
- "The second part of this question involved an overview of gabapentin pharmacology. Gabapentin is an amino acid analogue of GABA utilised in neuropathic pain and epilepsy."
