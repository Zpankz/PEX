title: "Describe the consequences for the left ventricle of a sudden and sustained increase in afterload."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2023
sitting: B
question: 17
passRate: 7
EC_expectedDomains:
- "effect of afterload on the left ventricle"
EC_extraCredit:
- "acute effect of increased afterload on left ventricular end systolic (and diastolic) pressure and volume, contractility, work and oxygen consumption, coronary perfusion pressure and baroreceptor responses"
- "longer term left ventricular exposure which would include the ventricular cellular response, concentric hypertrophy and the subsequent effects on diastolic and elevations of left atrial pressure"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This question expected a detailed description of the effect of afterload on the left ventricle."
- "Definitions of afterload, cardiac output equations, vascular function curves and LV/PV loops are not required if the above concepts are described in adequate detail."
