entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2009
sitting: B
question: 7
passRate: 22
lo:
- "[[P2e]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Good answers to this question directly compared the anatomical differences using two columns: one for the newborn and the other for the adult airway."
- "They further divided the differences anatomically into mouth/naso and oro pharynx, the glottis (and epiglottis), the larynx, and the trachea (main carina and main bronchi)."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common omissions were failure to mention that neonates do not have dentition, have more compliant tissues and reduced muscle tone, that the neonatesâ€™ larynx lies more cephalad and anteriorly, is covered by a large floppy epiglottis and that the main carina also lies more cephalad."
- "Few candidates were able to list more than 4 differences between the anatomy of the two airways and none mentioned the possibility of disease affecting the neck in the adult."
