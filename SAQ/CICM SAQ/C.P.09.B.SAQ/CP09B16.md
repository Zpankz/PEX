title: "Discuss the factors affecting pulmonary vascular resistance."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2009
sitting: B
question: 16
passRate: 33
lo:
- "[[B1i2b]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A good answer to this question required a discussion that focused on the following key pointsRecruitment and distension of pulmonary capillaries. Helps limit pulmonary vascular resistance as pressure and flow increase."
- "Lung volume. Lung inflation is thought to have a dual effect, expanding large vessels by traction while compressing smaller vessels and resistance is dependent upon lung volume, being lowest at approx FRC."
- "Gravity. Perfusion is distributed down a vertical gradient in the lung, reflecting the balance between intra-alveolar pressure and the distending vascular pressure. (Westâ€™s Zones)"
- "Oxygen. Hypoxia causes pulmonary vasoconstriction. Diverts blood away from hypoxic regions of the lung."
- "Hypercapnia and acidosis vasoconstriction Autonomic innervation. Alpha -adrenergic stimulation - vasoconstrictor, Beta-adrenergic stimulation - vasodilatation, Parasympathetic stimulation - Vasodilatation Local mediators. Vasoconstrictors (Serotonin, histamine, endothelins) and Vasodilators (NO, prostacyclin, isoprenaline)"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Those candidates who failed to do so were also those who scored fewer points with this question."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The majority of these points could be efficiently explained through the use of graphs/figures, all of which are commonly found in the majority of physiology books that include respiratory physiology."
