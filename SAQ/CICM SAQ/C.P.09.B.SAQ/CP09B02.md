title: "Describe the physiological consequences and responses after an acute haemorrhage of 2.0 litres in a healthy 70kg adult if there is no immediate fluid resuscitation."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2009
sitting: B
question: 2
passRate: 56
lo:
- "[[C1e1]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To adequately answer this question, candidates must be able to demonstrate that they recognised this to be a major haemorrhage."
- "When a weight and a volume are supplied it is expected the percentage blood loss would be calculated and the shock graded or the haemorrhage at least described as severe."
- "Consequences were best described in organ systems e.g. CV, renal, metabolic."
- "A good answer should include mention, and provide explanations, of the mechanisms for the following compensatory responses: Activation of both baroreceptors and chemoreceptors and their consequences, The sympathetic nervous system response, Fluid shifts, Renal effects, Endocrine effects, eg secretion and actions of ADH, ACTH/Cortisol"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Often the consequences were omitted."
- "Many candidates failed to mention the patient would be hypotensive and tachycardic."
EC_extraCredit:
- "most candidates mentioned the urine output would be decreased but did not provide a mechanism for this"
resources:
- "Textbook of Medical Physiology, Guyton and Hall"
- "Foundations of Anaesthesia: Basic Clinical Science, Hemmings and Hopkins"
