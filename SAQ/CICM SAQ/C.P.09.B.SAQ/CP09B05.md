title: "Outline the kinetic characteristics and the mode of action of digoxin. (75% of marks) List the cardiovascular effects of digoxin (25% of marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2009
sitting: B
question: 5
passRate: 0
lo:
- "[[C2c 2a]]"
- "[[C2c 2b]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Thus candidates were expected to briefly mention the fundamental pharmacokinetic characteristics (eg highly lipid soluble, well absorbed from small intestine, oral bioavailability of 60 - 90%, protein binding of 20 - 30%, volume of distribution, half life, etc) and mode of action."
- "Thus candidates were expected to broadly list the important cardiovascular effects relating to mechanical (eg increase intensity of myocardial contraction, direct venous and arteriolar constriction, etc) and electrical ( increase phase 4 slope & automaticity, hyperpolarization, shortening of atrial action potentials, decrease AV conduction velocity and prolong AV refractory period, increase PR & QT intervals, dose and baseline autonomic activity dependent actions, etc)."
- "The Syllabus for the Primary examination describes an outline to be “Provide a summary of the important points.”"
- "The question outlines the distribution of marks, being 25% for listing cardiovascular effects."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This was poorly done and candidates’ answers often lacked structure."
