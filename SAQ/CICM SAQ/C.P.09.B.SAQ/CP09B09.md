title: "A six (6) month old child is diagnosed with a gastric outlet obstruction. Investigations reveal a metabolic alkalosis and a urine pH of 5. Describe the physiological basis of these results."

EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to identify what compounds are lost during vomiting associated with gastric outlet obstruction and that intravascular volume depletion is likely."
- "Furthermore the candidate was then expected to explain that overall the child’s body will defend volume – then tonicity – then acid base status, in this order."
- "An outline of the major physiological defences of volume status (e.g. the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system), and how these will perpetuate a metabolic alkalosis (prevent the kidney from clearing the excess bicarbonate in the form of an alkaline urine) was then expected."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A common omission was to not appreciate that the preservation of volume (sodium or chloride) by the kidneys conflicts with the physiological mechanisms that would allow bicarbonate loss through the kidneys’ tubules."
- "Restoration of normovolaemia would allow an ‘alkaline tide’ or bicarbonate loss by the kidneys (alkaline urine production)."
