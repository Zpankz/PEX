title: "Define the following terms (40%)\n1. Saturated Vapour Pressure of Water\n2. Absolute Humidity\n3. Relative Humidity\n4. Latent heat of vaporisation\n\nBriefly outline how the humidity of air is altered during inspiration and expiration by the respiratory tract (60%)"

- "[[B1k2d]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The core of the second part required an outline of the exchange of heat and moisture through the upper airways and bronchial tree, culminating in fully saturated gas at core body temperature by level of the 2nd generation bronchi."
- "Whilst the question asked ‘humidity’ and not temperature, correct definitions in the first part would have dictated a joint outline of both."
- "The effects of surface area, the nasal turbinates, mucosal secretion and blood flow were all relevant."
- "The contribution to insensible moisture and heat loss should have been mentioned."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "It is essential that candidates read and respond to the question asked of them."
- "The first part of the question required simple, accurate definitions, which the majority of candidates were unable to provide."
- "Marks were awarded for the definition only. Descriptions of measurement, potential effects on oxygenation, etc. were not asked and gained no marks."
- "No candidate considered the effects of respiratory rate, mouth versus nose breathing, or dry medical gases versus room air."
