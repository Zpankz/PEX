title: "Explain the mechanisms by which a bacterium may become resistant to an antimicrobial agent and provide an example (organism and antimicrobial) of each mechanism. (60% of marks) How is antimicrobial resistance spread? (40% of marks)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2009
sitting: B
question: 1
passRate: 67

- "[[M2a2c]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to explain and provide an example of an antimicrobial agent for mechanisms such as enzyme inactivation of the antimicrobial, alteration of antimicrobial binding/target sites, reduction of antimicrobial drug uptake or active efflux of drug by the bacteria and alteration in enzymatic pathways."
- "Examples of the methods of spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria that were expected were: transfer of resistant bacteria from person to person; horizontal gene transfer; transduction - acquisition of bacterial DNA from a phage (a virus that propagates in bacteria); transformation - uptake and incorporation of free DNA released into the environment by other bacterial cells; conjugation - gene transfer (usually on plasmids), by direct cell-to-cell contact through a bridge."
- "Use of a table aided candidates expressing this information."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates could name various mechanisms of resistance but many failed to gain marks as they did not provide an example of an organism and antimicrobial."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The second part of the question concerning the spread of resistance was generally done quite well."
