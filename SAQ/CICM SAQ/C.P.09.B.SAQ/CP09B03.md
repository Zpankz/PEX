title: "Describe the factors that influence the speed of ONSET of neuromuscular blockade."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2009
sitting: B
question: 3
passRate: 0
lo:
- "[[H2a]]"
- "[[H2c]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Pharmacodynamic factors expected were those of mechanism of blockade, receptor affinity, agent potency, neuromuscular disorders, age, drug interactions and electrolyte disorders."
- "For example factors could be broadly classified as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors or patient and drug factors."
- "For example, pharmacokinetic factors could include dose, the use of a priming dose, patient’s volume status, cardiac output, muscle group and skeletal muscle blood flow."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The better candidates had an organised approach to their answer."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many answers listed factors which affect the duration of neuromuscular blockade instead of the onset."
- "Marks were not allocated for information provided by candidates that did not address the question asked. It is important that candidates provide an answer specific to the question asked."
- "Many candidates applied Fick’s Law inappropriately. Lipid solubility and pKa are not relevant as these drugs do not cross the nerve membrane."
