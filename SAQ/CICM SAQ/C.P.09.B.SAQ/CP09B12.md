- "Thus candidates should have prepared structured approach for any such question. For example, one that includes predefined major categories such as pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics and sub-categories such as mechanism of action, absorption, preparations, bioavailability, volume of distribution, metabolism, elimination, adverse effect, clinical indications, precautions/interactions, etc. and the information relevant to each category."
