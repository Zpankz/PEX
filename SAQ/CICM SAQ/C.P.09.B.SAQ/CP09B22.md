EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were essentially expected to describe the fate of sodium as t passes through the kidney from filtration at the glomerulus to ending up in the urine."
- "Essentially, most Na+ is reabsorbed at the proximal tubule (65%), reabsorption being down an electrochemical gradient (inside cell negative and low Na+ concentration) which is maintained by active Na+/K+ ATPase activity at the basolateral membrane."
- "Then Loop of Henle reabsorbs a further 15% of filtered Na+. At descending limb – no Na+ reabsorption. At ascending limb, thick segment – active process as per proximal tubule, but mostly coupled to K+ and Cl- and paracellular diffusion through tight junctions."
- "Finally the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts, a further almost 20% reabsorbed – leaving < 1%"
- "Factors influencing loss are - aldosterone = stimulates Na+ reabsorption at the collecting tubules - intra renal factors such as interstitial pressure which is lowered during hypovolaemia and reduced renal perfusion, thus promoting Na+ reabsorption gradient - sympathetic nervous system – influences interstitial pressure and increases renin production - angiotensin II – stimulates reabsorption at proximal tubule - Atrial Naturetic Peptide/Factor – inhibits Na+ reabsorption - Others – dopamine, cortisol, insulin => increase Na+ reabsorption, but minor factors"
