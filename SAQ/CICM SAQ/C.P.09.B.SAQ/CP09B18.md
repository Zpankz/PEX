EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answer it was expected that candidates would mention the relationship of angiotensinogen, angiotensin I, renin and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme to angiotensin II production, the actions and fate of angiotensin II and factors that regulate angiotensin II."
- "It was expected that candidates mention angiotensin acts as a potent vasoconstrictor, stimulates aldosterone secretion, facilitates noradrenaline release, preferentially vasoconstricts Efferent arteriole in nephron, preserving GFR in low perfusion states, increases renal tubular Na+ reabsorption and increases secretion of vasopressin and ACTH."
- "Regulation of Angiotensin could be separated into factors increasing angiotensin levels (eg prostaglandins, low K+ levels, Sympathetic stimulation, decreased Na+ delivery at distal tubule, any factor contributing to reduced renal blood flow (eg hyovolaemia, cardiac failure, renal artery stenosis) and factors reducing angiotensin levels (eg hypervolaemia, afferent arteriolar dilatation and vasopressin)."
