- "[[B1a]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A good answer necessitated the precise meaning of venous admixture, being that amount of mixed venous blood which would have to be added to ideal pulmonary end-capillary blood to explain the observed pulmonary end-capillary to arterial PO2 difference."
- "Diagnosis required the candidate to mention, a demonstrated increased in the Aa-DO2, what are normal values."
- "For quantification mention and description of the shunt equation was required."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates lacked a definition for venous admixture, were inaccurate with their description of the shunt equation and often overlooked mentioning calculation of arterial and mixed venous blood oxygen content."
EC_extraCredit:
- "This question related to an area of basic respiratory physiology."
