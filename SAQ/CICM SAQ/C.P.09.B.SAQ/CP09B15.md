title: "Describe the mechanism of actions and duration of effect of drugs used to lower potassium in hyperkalaemia."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2009
sitting: B
question: 15
passRate: 55
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Marks were divided between each of the following: 8.4%NaHCO3-, insulin/glucose, K+ exchange resin, frusemide/loop diuretics, Beta2 agonists and K+ free fluid rehydration/dilution."
- "Candidates often overlooked the fact that only loop diuretics and K+ exchange resins lower total body K+ content, whilst the others induce an intracellular K+ shift which is not sustained and do not directly result in body elimination of K+."
- "Intravenous fluid rehydration lowers total body K+ if there is a resulting diuresis."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A good answer to this question required the collation of knowledge from broad range of areas, ie drug activity."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common omissions included NaHCO3, loop diuretics and beta 2 agonists."
- "No candidate mentioned rehydration/dilution."
- "Calcium does not lower serum potassium."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most candidates just passed this question."
resources:
- "various"
