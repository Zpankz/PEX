EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to state the purpose of the blood brain barrier (BBB), define what constituted the BBB, what its function is, and what parts of the brain lie outside of this barrier (and why)."
- "Further candidates should have mentioned what substances cross the BBB, and how this is achieved."
- "Characteristics of a drug that will penetrate the BBB included low molecular weight, good lipid solubility, a low volume of distribution, low potency and low protein binding."
- "Also expected was a discussion of Fickâ€™s Law and the drug features that would allow a high concentration gradient in the cerebral blood vessels to be achieved and a high diffusion coefficient and mention of drugs that resemble natural ligands for active transport mechanisms."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common omissions included not mentioning the presence of astrocyte foot processes in addition to the tight junctions between the capillary endothelial cells, the presence of active pumps for sugars amines, and some ions, and what parts of the brain lay outside of the BBB."
