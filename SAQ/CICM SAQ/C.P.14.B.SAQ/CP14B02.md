EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers were able to distil major issues such as the narrow therapeutic window for phenytoin or the potential clinical impact of differing ordered kinetics or altered metabolism."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The knowledge of phenytoin was often superficial and many answers were too brief and didnâ€™t adequately cover the required material."
- "The knowledge around levetiracetam seemed very limited with many candidates guessing (incorrectly) what the pharmacokinetics might be."
- "Candidates are reminded to read each question carefully; levetiracetam should not be confused with levosimendin."
