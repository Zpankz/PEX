title: "Describe baroreceptors and their role in the control of blood pressure."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2014
sitting: B
question: 16
passRate: 62
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers provided some detail on the innervation for these receptors."
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected candidates would describe that increased baroreceptor discharge inhibits the tonic discharge of sympathetic nerves and excites the vagal innervation of the heart."
- "This results in vasodilation, venodilation, a drop in blood pressure, bradycardia and a decreased cardiac output."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some candidates had a major misunderstanding around the purpose of \"low pressure baroreceptors\" with many believing that these are the ones that respond to lower blood pressures, while the \"high pressure baroreceptors\" respond to higher blood pressures."
