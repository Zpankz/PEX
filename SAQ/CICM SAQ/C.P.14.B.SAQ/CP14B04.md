sitting: B
question: 04

EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected an answer would mention the central role of Acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter at preganglionic and post ganglionic neurons in the parasympathetic system."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Generally there was a lack of detailed knowledge, incorrect facts and at times confusion between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system functions."
- "A lack of anatomical detail was common (the origin of preganglionic cell bodies was not described clearly, and parasympathetic ganglia were not often named and located)."
- "Target organs were identified correctly but the exact action was not specified e.g. pupillary constriction vs. dilatation, GI sphincter/bladder - contraction vs. relaxation."
- "Detail concerning receptor physiology was not required."
- "This is a question covering a core topic that no candidate passed."
