title: "Describe the effects of V/Q inequality on the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2) in arterial blood."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2014
sitting: B
question: 05
passRate: 8
EC_expectedDomains:
- "V/Q scatter as well as true shunt (V/Q=0) and dead space (V/Q=âˆž) needed to be considered."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Very few candidates demonstrated understanding of this core topic."
- "Candidates did not accurately define V/Q inequality and the physiological factors causing this phenomenon."
- "The inability of high V/Q areas to compensate for low V/Q zones owing to the relatively small contribution of blood flow from these high V/Q units was not discussed."
- "The differential effect of FiO2 on true shunt versus V/Q scatter was seldom explained."
- "The shape of the oxy-Hb dissociation curve and CO2-dissociation curve were sometimes mentioned but their effect on arterial gas tensions not well explained."
- "Often graphs were reproduced inaccurately and contradictory statements made, leaving the impression that candidates did not understand the basic concepts."
