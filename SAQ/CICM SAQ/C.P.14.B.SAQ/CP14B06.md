EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates did not read the question carefully and misinterpreted what was being asked."
- "Candidates often digressed into a discussion of thermoregulation."
- "Several candidates wrote about body's response to cold and heat rather than mechanisms of heat production and loss as was asked."
- "There was confusion between mechanisms of endogenous heat production and measures to conserve heat."
- "\"Behaviour\" only attracted marks in relation to voluntary muscle activity for heat production."
- "Changing clothes or seeking a warm environment does not increase heat output by the body. Behaviour can reduce heat loss."
- "Many candidates did not specify ambient or core body temperature."
- "The definitions of Thermoneutral Zone and Interthreshold Range were not clear."
- "Knowledge generally lacked detail and this was most evident when precise definitions were asked."
