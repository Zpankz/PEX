EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates who structured their answer into pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors generally scored better marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A structured approach would work well for this question but was often lacking."
- "Many answers were superficial providing short lists of factors affecting NDMRs without reference to mechanism."
- "Candidates failed to differentiate factors which potentiate NDMRs from those which inhibit the action of the drugs."
- "Some confusion also existed confusing speed of onset kinetics with potentiation kinetics."
- "Candidates who used pre-post synaptic type structure tended to omit kinetics completely from their answers."
- "Incorrect facts were common."
