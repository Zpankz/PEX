title: "Describe the physiological control of systemic vascular resistance (SVR)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2022
sitting: A
question: 20
passRate: 22
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A definition or description of SVR that recognised the importance of radius in small arteries/arterioles as the major determinant"
- "Resistance is ΔP/flow; where ΔP is not only MAP and flow is volume/time."
- "The systemic vascular resistance is the resistance of several circuits in parallel, which have both common and independent factors in their regulation."
- "An approach that included sensors, integrators and effectors"
- "Divisions into intrinsic/local factors (including endothelial input and autoregulation), neural control (reflexes and central controller) and hormonal control."
EC_extraCredit:
- "As a question regarding control, an approach that included sensors, integrators and effectors tended to yield a more comprehensive answer with resultant higher marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A detailed explanation of the Hagen-Pouiselle law was not required, attracted few marks and wasted writing time."
- "As the question was regarding physiological control, no marks were awarded to pharmacological manipulation of SVR."
- "stating 'sympathetic nervous system activation results in vasoconstriction' were too simplistic to attract full marks."
