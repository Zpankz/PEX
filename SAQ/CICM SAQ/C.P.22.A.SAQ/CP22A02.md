- "Classification of the mechanisms of transport into active and passive processes"
- "The structure of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump"
- "Its role and function"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Answers that scored well generally classified the mechanisms of transport into active and passive processes which ensured an appropriate breadth of answer."
- "pleasingly most candidates were able to accurately articulate its role and function."
EC_errorsCommon:
