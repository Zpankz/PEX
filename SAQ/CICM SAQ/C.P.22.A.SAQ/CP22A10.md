title: "Discuss the determinants of intracranial pressure (80% marks) and outline how it can be measured (20% marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2022
sitting: A
question: 10
passRate: 64
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The volumes of the cranium and a correct description of the Monroe Kellie doctrine."
- "The compensations and consequences of increases in intra-cranial volumes"
- "A discussion of all three components (brain tissue, blood, and CSF) and how they affect intracranial pressure"
- "Information on intra-ventricular and parenchymal devices in measuring ICP, briefly including their pros and cons."
EC_extraCredit:
- "In the good answers to this question, and there were a number, the candidates included the volumes of the cranium and a correct description of the Monroe Kellie doctrine."
- "A good answer should have included the compensations and consequences of increases in intra-cranial volumes; a discussion of all three components (brain tissue, blood, and CSF) and how they affect intracranial pressure; and then information on intra-ventricular and parenchymal devices in measuring ICP, briefly including their pros and cons."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A common issue was writing quite a lot more than was needed on the relationship of cerebral blood flow to cerebral blood volume, and/or on the physiological consequences of raised ICP, which seemed to leave little time for discussion elsewhere."
- "A few candidates did not provide any response for ICP measurement (worth 20% of the marks)."
- "Few candidates provided the intra-cranial elastance equation."
- "A significant proportion of candidates missed out a part of the question, either the factors that affect CBV or ICP measurement."
