EC_expectedDomains:
- "A concise definition and distinguish between the different types of compliance"
- "The relevant components of compliance and the factors that influence it"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Marks were maximised by dividing the impacts into those that altered lung compliance versus those that impacted on chest wall compliance, and the better candidates explained how and why compliance was affected."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The imprecise use of terminology often created the impression of a lack of fundamental understanding of this key concept."
- "A lack of detail in describing the relevant components of compliance and the factors that influence it, immediately limited the capacity of some candidates to achieve an adequate score."
- "Most candidates provided less than half of these factors and only provided a list rather than explaining how compliance was impacted."
- "Confusion often arose from the imprecise use of arrows with the result that candidates frequently demonstrated an incorrect fact in relation to the direction of the arrow."
