title: "Outline the impact of sedative agents on thermoregulation (40% marks) and describe the physiological effects of a low body temperature (60% marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2022
sitting: A
question: 16
passRate: 33
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Sedation reduces body temperature by interfering with heat production and increasing heat loss, along with widening of hypothalamic inter-threshold range."
- "The physiological effect of low body temperature with the structure of organ-system wise description."
- "Understanding of core temperature regulation, inter-threshold range and the effects of sedatives on thresholds for thermogenic responses, although only a few mentioned gain and maximal response."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A few candidates scored extra marks by relating these effects with degree of hypothermia and by describing how thermogenesis responses (including shivering) can influence those effects."
- "Better answers displayed an understanding of core temperature regulation, inter-threshold range and the effects of sedatives on thresholds for thermogenic responses, although only a few mentioned gain and maximal response."
- "Better answers included specific detail (mentioned bradyarrhythmia, slow AF, VF, prolonged PR/QRS / J waves rather than just stating arrhythmia) across several organ systems."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates actually described the thermoregulation process in general but were unable to relate those with the impact of sedation."
- "Some candidates restricted their answers to the effect of thermogenesis in response hypothermia and did not include the overall physiological consequences of low body temperature."
- "Marks were not awarded for generic statements such as 'decreased liver function' without some additional detail."
- "Inadequate depth of knowledge was main reason behind overall poor scores."
