entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM

sitting: A
question: 4
passRate: 15
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The mechanism of action of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO)"
- "Knowledge about prostacyclin and the adverse effects of both commonly used drugs"
- "Methaemoglobin and its effects"
- "Understanding the rational for restricting the concentration of iNO (ppm) because of the risk of N02 formation"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Methaemoglobin and its effects were reasonably described with many understanding the rational for restricting the concentration of iNO (ppm) because of the risk of N02 formation."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "many demonstrated very little knowledge about prostacyclin and the adverse effects of both commonly used drugs."
- "General statements about NO, itâ€™s delivery and pharmacological effects did not attract marks candidates are encouraged to read the question and provide information specific to the question."
- "The knowledge related to prostacyclin was very limited."
- "Such limited detail as to its mechanism of action prevented any discussion regarding any differences from iNO."
- "Many reasonable answers to the iNO component were limited overall due to a paucity of knowledge and incorrect facts in the prostacyclin section."
