title: "Describe the regulation of systemic vascular resistance (SVR)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2024
sitting: B
question: 2
passRate: 38
EC_expectedDomains:
- "definition of SVR, site of highest resistance, equation, and correct units"
- "descriptions of: inputs (peripheral and central); the central integrator (vasomotor centre); and controllers such as neural output, hormones, and local factors"
- "Inputs include carotid and cardiopulmonary baroreceptors, peripheral and central chemoreceptors, and other factors such as visceral distention"
- "Neural outputs include the autonomic nervous system and their contribution to basal tone"
- "Hormones include angiotensin II, vasopressin, ANP, and progesterone. Local regulation includes myogenic, metabolic, endothelin, and endothelium-derived hyperpolarization factors"
EC_extraCredit:
- "brief explanation of how each factor contributes to SVR and the conditions under which they operate"
