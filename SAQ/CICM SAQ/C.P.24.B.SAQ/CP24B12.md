title: "Describe the physiological factors that affect the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. (Measurement factors are not required)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2024
sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 30
EC_expectedDomains:
- "structured approach discussing CO2 production, carriage in the blood, CO2 elimination, and the control of ventilation, providing specific detail on how each of these affected arterial partial pressures of CO2"
- "CO2 production should include an overview of CO2 as a product of aerobic respiration, an approximation of the rate of production, how it varies with metabolic activity, and finally the concept of RQ with its determinants"
- "Carriage should include an estimate of CO2 content, how PaCO2 depends upon the amount dissolved (as per Henry's Law), how CO2 is carried in the blood enabling more total content relative to the amount dissolved, the influence of the Haldane effect, and how CO2 is more soluble at lower temperature lowering PaCO2"
- "Elimination should emphasise the importance of minute ventilation, dead space (including effective dead space due to high VQ lung units), and the effect of rebreathing CO2"
- "Control of ventilation required a brief overview of the sensors, including central and peripheral chemoreceptors, integrators, and effectors that influence the minute ventilation and ultimately PaCO2"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Given this breadth, less detail was expected"
