EC_expectedDomains:
- "GFR equation provides a logical basis to structure an answer"
- "discussion of factors affecting each part of the equation"
- "glomerular hydrostatic pressure, Bowmanâ€™s capsule hydrostatic pressure, glomerular capillary oncotic pressure, and the filtration coefficient, providing information on what is responsible for each of these factors and how changes affect GFR"
- "definition of clearance and description of the use of inulin versus creatinine, touching on advantages and disadvantages"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "methods used to estimate GFR such as the Cockcroft and Gault equation were often not included"
