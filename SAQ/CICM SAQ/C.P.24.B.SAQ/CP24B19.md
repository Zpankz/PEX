title: "Describe the pharmacology of oxygen."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2024
sitting: B
question: 19
passRate: 33
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to describe the pharmacology of oxygen under the following headings: pharmaceutics/preparation, mechanism of action, indications/uses, administration methods, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicity"
- "Pharmaceutics included the properties of oxygen and its manufacturing and storage. Administration by inhalation may be via fixed and variable performance devices"
- "Indications included causes of hypoxaemia, but there are others such as de-nitrogenation of gas-filled spaces, and various indications for hyperbaric O2 therapy"
- "Mechanism of action involved mentioning oxidative phosphorylation occurring in the mitochondria where O2 functions as the final electron acceptor. Other mechanisms include biochemical pathways requiring O2 as a substrate, and generation of reactive oxygen species by neutrophils and macrophages for antimicrobial purposes"
- "Pharmacokinetics required a description of diffusion across the alveolar membrane, binding to Hb and the small amount in solution, metabolism in mitochondria, and excretion subsequently of CO2 and H20"
- "Pharmacodynamics required mention of systemic vasoconstriction, effects on the respiratory system such as de-nitrogenation of gas-filled spaces, absorption atelectasis, inhibition of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and risk of hypercapnia in select patients with COPD"
- "Side effects involve reactive oxygen species, and awareness of dose and time of exposure as relevant factors. There is a risk of delirium/seizures in hyperbaric oxygen, and longer-term risks of pulmonary toxicity and to the premature neonate of retrolental fibroplasia and retinopathy"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Answers were elevated by quantitation of O2 uptake, O2 carriage, mention of the importance of pressure gradients (O2 cascade), and O2 stores"
- "Given the breadth of the question, the detail of answers will be inherently limited by time; however, some specific details were important"
