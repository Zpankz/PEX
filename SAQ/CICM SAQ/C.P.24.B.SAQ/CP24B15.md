EC_expectedDomains:
- "list of the different nerve fibre types including the breakdown of A, B, and C fibres along with their primary function, for example, motor/sensory/parasympathetic/sympathetic, presence of myelin, size, and velocity of conduction"
- "mechanism by which an action potential arises and is propagated in a myelinated nerve"
- "detailed overview of electrolyte movement across the neuronal membrane during depolarisation, timing, and explanation of the refractory period, the basis for unidirectional movement, and the mechanism of saltatory conduction which occurs in a myelinated nerve"
