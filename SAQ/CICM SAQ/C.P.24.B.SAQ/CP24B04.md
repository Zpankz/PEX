entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2024
sitting: B
question: 4
passRate: 53
EC_expectedDomains:
- "detailed description of both the macro and microstructure of skeletal and smooth muscle, noting differences and similarities"
- "for skeletal muscle, specific detail on fibre arrangement, subtypes (I/IIA/IIB), and their innervation, as well as the structure of the sarcomere, thick and thin bands, and associated proteins was required"
- "candidates would provide a description of how these components are similar or different in smooth muscle, including details of unitary and multi-unit smooth muscle arrangements"
- "process of AP generation, propagation, and stimulus, but also detailed sources of ATP, and highlighting differences in energy requirements of each muscle type"
- "specific membrane potentials, noting the unstable membrane potential of smooth muscle, which does not exhibit a resting membrane potential"
