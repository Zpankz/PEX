title: "Outline the following with respect to ultrasound: (a) The physical principles when used for tissue imaging using the following headings: i. generation and detection of the ultrasound; ii. reflection and scattering; iii. attenuation; iv. refraction. (35% of marks) (b) The relationship between transducer properties, image resolution and tissue penetration. (35% of marks). (c) The principles of the doppler effect and its applications. (30% of marks)."

EC_expectedDomains:
- "definition of the principle followed by a brief description or overview"
- "definition of the concepts of generation/detection/reflection/scattering/attenuation and refraction, and then used this to describe how the ultrasound image is produced or disrupted due to these factors"
- "link how the transducer and its frequency affects axial, linear, contrast, and temporal resolution"
- "relationship between frequency/wavelength, tissue penetration, and image resolution"
- "explanation of the doppler effect and how it is used in medical ultrasound, for example, measurement of blood flow and direction"
EC_extraCredit:
- "The Doppler equation was not required for full marks, though it did help some candidates explain the doppler effect"
