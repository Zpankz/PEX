EC_expectedDomains:
- "Grouping of bacteria into gram-positive cocci, gram-positive bacilli, gram-negative cocci, gram-negative bacilli, and others was expected with appropriate examples"
- "A list of two antimicrobials that can be used against each of these classifications followed, and a brief outline of their mechanism of action was expected"
- "Mechanisms of resistance included innate and acquired. Aspects of acquired resistance expected were genetic factors that alter the bacterial target, changes in bacterial permeability/efflux pumps, and presence of enzymes that modify or negate the drug"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A description of the gram stain procedure or discussion of bacterial cell wall characteristics was not required"
