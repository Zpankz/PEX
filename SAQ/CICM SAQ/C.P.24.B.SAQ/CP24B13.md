title: "(a) Define ventricular diastole, including its usual duration (15% of marks). (b) Describe the cardiovascular events that occur during this period (85% of marks). (ionic and cellular events not required)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2024
sitting: B
question: 13
passRate: 38
EC_expectedDomains:
- "accurate definition of ventricular diastole providing detail about duration (either duration at a certain heart rate or the usual ratio with changes due to tachycardia)"
- "dividing the events into cardiac mechanical and electrical events and circulatory changes"
- "Mechanical events included a description of isovolumetric relaxation, early filling, atrial ejection, and isovolumetric contraction, with an explanation of what marks the beginning and end of each of these phases, as well as what happens to pressures within the cardiac chambers"
- "Electrical events included the correlation of diastole with ventricular repolarisation and refractory periods, as well as the corresponding ECG waves"
- "overview of the changes that occur in the coronary, pulmonary, and systemic circulations during diastole"
