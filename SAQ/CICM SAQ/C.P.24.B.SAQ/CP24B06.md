entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2024
sitting: B
question: 6
passRate: 36
EC_expectedDomains:
- "sites of production with some estimate of daily production"
- "synthesis via glycolysis, pentose-phosphate pathway (HMP shunt), the chemical reaction catalysed by LDH along with conversion of NADH to NAD"
- "explanation of mechanisms other than anaerobic conditions that lead to increased lactate production"
- "overview of hepatic uptake and the Cori cycle, the role of renal metabolism and excretion, and mitochondrial tissue handling"
- "discussion of its use as a fuel for cells (including the myocardium, erythrocytes, astrocytes, and skeletal muscle). Lactateâ€™s role as a neurotransmitter and in autoregulation, including cerebral vasculature"
