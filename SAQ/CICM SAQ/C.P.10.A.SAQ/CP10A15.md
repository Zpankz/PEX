EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected that candidates would give Fick’s equation and describe the components : Fick’s Law J = -DA dc/dx."
- "Candidates were also expected to describe Starlings equation and the equation for Osmotic Pressure."
- "Starling Equation: Fluid movement = k[(Pc-Pi) – s(πp – πi)] Osmotic pressure : sRT(Ci-Co)."
- "Gibb’s Donnan effect and, other mechanisms of transport (filtration and pinocytosis) was also expected for a good answer."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good answers were based around Fick’s Law, Starling forces and the Gibb’s Donnan effect."
