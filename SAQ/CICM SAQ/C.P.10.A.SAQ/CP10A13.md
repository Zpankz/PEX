EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answer candidates were expected to mention the role of serotonin (5 hydroxytryptamine) is an important neurotransmitter, a local hormone in the GIT and involved in platelet reactions."
- "It is formed from tryptophan and metabolised by MAO (thus the potential effect of a combination SSRI with MAO inhibitor, or concurrent use of several serotonin affecting drugs)."
- "Typically the serotonin syndrome is a predictable effect of increased CNS levels of serotonin with a consequence of hyper reflexia, tremor, clonus, skeletal muscle contraction and hyperthermia (but in serotonin syndrome these effects are probably CNS mediated), hypertension, and diarrhoea."
- "The expected list of drugs included the SSRI’s themselves, combination of SSRI’s and MAOI’s, antidepressants (2nd generation [e.g Venlafaxine]) ,Tramadol (blocks serotonin re-uptake), pethidine, fentanyl, ondansetron, sumatriptan (5-HT1 agonist)."
