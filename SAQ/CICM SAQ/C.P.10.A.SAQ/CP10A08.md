title: "Describe the role of the kidney in drug excretion and the factors affecting this (80% marks). Briefly outline how you would alter the dosing of a drug with high renal excretion in a patient with renal impairment (20% marks)."

EC_expectedDomains:
- "The preponderance of marks was allocated to a discussion of renal drug excretion and factors altering this function."
- "Detail was expected including a definition of clearance, and the balance between filtration / secretion / reabsorption in the tubules."
- "Specific mention of GFR, molecular weight of filterable compounds, protein binding, and charge effects determining filtration at the glomerular level was anticipated."
- "Tubular transport mechanisms for secretion and reabsorption in the proximal and distal tubule should have been included in the discussion."
- "Candidates needed to cover factors which alter GFR, competition for transport proteins, changes in pH on drug elimination, and disease states in answering the question."
- "An understanding that drug dosing should be based on estimating creatinine clearance and plasma concentration monitoring was essential."
- "Loading dose is usually unaltered."
- "However, maintenance dose and dosing interval need to be adjusted owing to an increased half-life."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates did not emphasise the need to increase dosing interval as well as reduce maintenance dose in renal impairment."
