title: "Outline the classification of viruses giving examples of each class (60% marks). Describe the mechanism of action of acyclovir and oseltamivir (40% marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2010
sitting: A
question: 12
passRate: 10
lo:
- "[[M2 2a]]"
- "[[M2d]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Viruses are classified according to a) genetic material b) mode replication c) structural proteins (capsids) d) presence of an envelope Thus DNA viruses, double or single stranded DNA usually replicate in the nucleus of the host cell via polymerase, not incorporated into the host genetic material."
- "Examples being double stranded, herpes, adenovirus, poxvirus and single stranded, parvovirus."
- "In comparison, RNA viruses, single strand and have 2 different reproduction strategies, being RNA sense(positive) and RNA antisense(negative), an example is paramyxovirus."
- "For retroviruses, the single stranded RNA canâ€™t act as mRNA and is transcribed into DNA by a reverse transcriptase."
- "This DNA is incorporated into the host DNA, so the host makes the viral RNA, for example HIV."
- "Candidates were also expected to briefly mention capsids and viral envelopes."
- "In relation to the second part of the question, candidates were expected to mention that acyclovir inhibits DNA polymerase in the terminal nucleic acid chain and that oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor which prevents the budding of new viruses from the infected cells."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates had very little knowledge of this area."
