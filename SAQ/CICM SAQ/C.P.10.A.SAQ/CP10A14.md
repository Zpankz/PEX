- "[[R2f]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected candidates would outline the underlying principles of ultrasound imaging (reflection, scattering , refraction, and attenuation) and discuss that the basic image is the result of reflection of the transmitted ultrasound wave."
- "While high levels of technical details were not required the answer should include a mention of the use a piezoelectric transducer and that an ultrasound beam has 3 dimensions – Axial, Elevation and Lateral."
- "Some comment of the modes of Display (A= Amplitude , M = Time Motion , 2D , etc) was expected."
- "Specific comment on the Doppler Effect was required."
- "It was expected candidates would described that it refers to the change in frequency of a sound wave reflected by a moving target and that the reflected frequency differs if moving toward or away."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most candidates appreciated that the amplitude of the reflected echo is a function of the acoustic mismatch of the tissues and the angle of incidence and many candidates provided details mathematical descriptions concerning these principles."
- "Extra credit was given for answers that included details regarding limits of depth of penetration ( longer wavelength penetrate deeper , but loose image quality with longer wavelengths) and the varying properties of human tissue regarding refraction and attenuation (little refraction (path deviation) in human tissue and air attenuates)."
- "Correctly stating that the reflected Frequency is HIGHER TOWARDS and LOWER AWAY scored additional marks Comments concerning obtaining the best Doppler images with lower frequencies ( opposite to u/s ) and colour Doppler attracted additional marks."
