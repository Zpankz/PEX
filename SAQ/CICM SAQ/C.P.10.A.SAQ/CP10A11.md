title: "Describe a set of arterial blood gases in a pregnant woman at term and the reasons for these values."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2010
sitting: A
question: 11
passRate: 20
lo:
- "[[O1]]"
- "[[2a]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answer candidates were expected to describe the respiratory alkalosis and metabolic compensation associated with pregnancy."
- "Candidates were expected to write a set of arterial blood gases showing a compensated respiratory alkalosis with a normal to slightly high P02."
- "Values within +/- 5% of those expected, and found, in listed references would have scored candidates marks."
- "Candidates were then expected to mention that the PaO2 is high despite a 20% increase in oxygen consumption (relate that to increase in alveolar ventilation, decrease in PaCO2, and alveolar gas equation; PaCO2 is low due to tidal volume increase by 35%, Although anatomical dead space increases VD/VT in unchanged, despite CO2 production increased by increased basal metabolic rate; HCO3 decreases because of increased renal excretion of HCO3 due to inhibition of renal secretion of hydrogen ions and ammonium; base deficit reflects the renal loss of HCO3."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some candidates described a low maternal P02, none commented on how the maternal P02 and PC02 enhance gas exchange to the foetus."
- "While electrolyte values are often measured on arterial blood gas analysis they do not form part of an arterial blood gas and so comments on electrolytes gained no marks."
- "The double Bohr and double Haldane effects were not required to answer this question."
- "Once again, this question highlighted the importance of a structured approach to the answer, thus enhancing a candidates opportunity to cover all key areas and put their knowledge across."
