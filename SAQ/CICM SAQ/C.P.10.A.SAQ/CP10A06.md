EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answers candidates where expected to list and explain (preferably by including diagrams) physiological factors such as PaCO2, PaO2, pH, Exercise, temperature, pregnancy and the associated receptors for each mechanism."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good candidates had a structured approach to this questions."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidate answers that lacked any structure were more likely to have omissions and lacked sufficient depth and as a result scored fewer marks."
- "Submitted question structures took the form of key headings (eg, PaCO2, PaO2, pH, etc) with an accompanying explanation, which included diagrams, which were often underutilised."
