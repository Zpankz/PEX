entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2010
sitting: A
question: 07
passRate: 60
lo:
- "[[C2d 2]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question required a classification based on chemical structure and class action."
- "Sympathomimetics, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, calcium sensitizers and cardiac glycosides should have been mentioned."
- "Discussion of receptors, second messengers, and the role of calcium was essential."
- "The question was aimed at “commonly used” agents, although some marks were awarded for discussion of calcium, glucagon and other rarely used drugs."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers included diagrams illustrating the mechanism and point of action on the cardiac myocyte."
- "Additional detail was expected, subdividing Sympathomimetics into catecholamines (naturally occurring and synthetic), and non-catecholamines (direct and indirect acting)."
- "Further classification based on peripheral vasomotor action demonstrated greater understanding."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Insufficient detail regarding mechanisms of action was a common observation."
