EC_expectedDomains:
- "A definition based on stretch of the isolated myocyte prior to contraction, and extrapolation to the human heart, was expected."
- "Surrogate measures of preload used in clinical practice needed to be explained and related to the definition (for example, end-diastolic volume and central venous pressure)."
- "At a minimum, detail should have included atrial contractility, diastolic filling time, ventricular compliance, and the determinants of venous return."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The Frank-Starling Law was relevant to discussion of the significance of preload to cardiac performance."
- "A diagram illustrating the interaction of important factors would have been helpful in answering this question."
- "Better answers included discussion of the effects of afterload, arrhythmias, and valvular pathology."
- "A distinction between the factors determining left and right ventricular preload would have demonstrated a more sophisticated understanding of the physiology."
