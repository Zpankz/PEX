title: "Describe the types of dead space in the respiratory system (50% marks). Explain the consequences of increased dead space on gas exchange (50% mark)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2010
sitting: A
question: 19
passRate: 50
lo:
- "[[B1e 2c]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A definition of dead space incorporating subtypes (anatomical, apparatus, alveolar, physiological) was expected."
- "Changes to End-tidal CO2 relative to PaCO2 were relevant to the question."
- "Causes of an increased dead space should have been described including hypoperfusion and increased alveolar pressure."
- "Increased dead space primarily results in CO2 retention, unless minute ventilation is increased commensurately."
- "The physiological effects of increased PaCO 2, increased respiratory rate and work of breathing are central to the question."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Explanation of measurement methods attracted additional marks."
- "The Bohr equation was stated and variables defined in better answers."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates predicted severe hypoxemia; however the alveolar gas equation was not stated to explain this observation."
- "Hypoxemia is a relatively late effect of significant hypo-ventilation, especially if the patient is breathing supplemental O2."
