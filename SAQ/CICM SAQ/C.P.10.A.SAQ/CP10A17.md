title: "With regard to ORAL drug dosing, describe the factors that affect the fraction of drug reaching the systemic circulation (80% marks). How may these factors be altered in a patient with shock (20% marks)?"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2010
sitting: A
question: 17
passRate: 60
lo:
- "[[Section II]]"
- "[[2a]]"
- "[[b]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answer candidates were expected to define bioavailability and the factors that affected a drugs oral bioavailability."
- "For example, factors affecting absorption (Metabolism by gut flora, drug / drug interactions with in the gut, lipophilicity and hydrophilicity of the drug (drug that are markedly lipophilic or hydrophilic cross the mucus layer or villous membrane poorly), First Pass clearance and sites and mechanism of possible metabolism, to define hepatic clearance, extraction ratio (providing a formula proved helpful to many candidates) and factors that affected hepatic drug clearance."
- "In relation to the second part of the question, candidates were expected to mention the effects of reduced absorption and altered first pass metabolism resulting in uncertain bioavailability of oral drugs."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates often lacked an understanding of this area, or failed to mention it."
