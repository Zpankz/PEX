EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answer, candidates were expected to take the following approach and content of information."
- "Triggers or initiators of vomiting include: Excessive distension or irritation of the upper GI tract, in particular the duodenum Stimulation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) Directly by certain drugs eg apomorphine, morphin Rhythmic motion of the body stimulating the vestibular labyrinth of the inner ear Cerebral excitation of vomiting by stimuli such as disquieting scenes, odors"
- "Neuronal pathways: Stimuli of the GI tract conveyed by vagal and sympathetic afferents to the bilateral vomiting centre within the medulla."
- "Efferent arc from the vomiting centre via the 5th,7th,9th,10th and 12th cranial nerves, and spinal nerves to the abdominal wall muscles (and the diaphragm)."
- "Vomiting act: Antiperistalsis as the prelude to vomiting At the onset of vomiting, strong intrinsic contractions occur in both the duodenum and the stomach Partial relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) Deep breath Raising of the hyoid/larynx to open the upper oesophageal sphincter Glottic closure Lifting of the soft palate to close the posterior nares Strong down ward contraction of diaphragm and simultaneous contraction of all the abdominal wall muscles Complete relaxation of the LOS"

- "Antiemetic drugs and their mechanism of action gained no marks."
