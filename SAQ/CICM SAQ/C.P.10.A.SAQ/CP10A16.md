entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2010
sitting: A
question: 16
passRate: 80
lo:
- "[[C1c]]"
- "[[2d]]"
- "[[C2b]]"
- "[[2e]]"
- "[[C2a]]"
- "[[2d]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answer candidates were expected to make some mention of the link between myocardial O2 demand / heart rate / contractilty."
- "For a good answers candidateswere expected to mention metoprolol effects of reducing left ventricular wall stress , decreased C AMP / mechanism, decreased hear rate, contractility, resultant decreased O2 demand as well as adverse effects include Bradycardia / heart block / hypotension / bronchconctriction, etc."
- "In relation to Glyceryl trinitrate, to mention dilation via nitric oxide, predominately venodilatation, decreased venous return, LVEDP, Wall stress, decreased demand O2 demand and increased supply via coronary vasodilation and adverse effects include hypotension / tachycardia tolerance / headache."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good answers had a structured response."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This was often overlooked, and candidates who did tended to not respond to what the question was asking, that is “when used to manage myocardial ischaemia”."
- "Candidates are reminded that if they are to use non standard abbreviations, then those abbreviations must be defined somewhere within their answer."
