- "[[G1]]"
- "[[2d]]"
- "[[g]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A good answer made mention of normal values of ICP, it’s variation with respiration and blood pressure and illustrated a trace of the ICP."
- "An explanation of the Monroe Kelly doctrine was expected, CSF production and absorption and it’s relationship to raised ICP as well other compensatory mechanisms for a high ICP (eg displacement of CSF into spinal canal, displacement of venous blood into the jugular veins, rise in ICP leads to ischaemia if the brain."
- "Critical ischaemia invokes the Cushing reflex."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates who did well in this question used graphs to describe the various concepts, described normal physiology and covered the breadth of the topic."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Major omissions by candidates was the use of diagrams, description of normal variation and only a superficial knowledge of compensatory mechanisms."
resources:
- "Textbook of Medical Physiology, Guyton, Chp 61"
