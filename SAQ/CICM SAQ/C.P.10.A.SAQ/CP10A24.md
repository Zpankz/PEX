title: "Describe the mechanism of action of the analgesic effect of opiates (70% marks). Explain the mechanisms by which morphine causes respiratory depression and constipation (30% marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2010
sitting: A
question: 24
passRate: 30

- "[[G2b]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answer candidates were expected to mention that opiate agonists produce analgesia by binding to Mu receptors (which are G protein coupled) in the central and peripheral nervous system and spinal cord and their cellular mechanism of action eg presynaptic neurone - close voltage gated Ca channels and prevent neurotransmitter release and post synaptic neurone hyperpolarise and inhibit post synaptic neurone."
- "Mechanism of respiratory depression is mediated via mu receptor. It occurs at normal analgesic doses, and decreases the chemosensitivity of the respiratory centre to PaCO2."
- "Mechanism of constipation results from increased tone and decreased motility of the GIT via action on visceral smooth muscle mediated by intramural nerve plexus and all three opioid receptors."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The fact that opiates also affect emotional side of pain and cause euphoria which may help with pain perception was often omitted."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This was a multi-part question, for which many candidates failed to apportion their time as indicated by the question."
- "Many candidates had poor organisation and poor knowledge of all aspects of this question."
