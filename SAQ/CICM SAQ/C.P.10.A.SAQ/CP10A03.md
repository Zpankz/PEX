- "[[J2. 1]]"
- "[[J2. 2e]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected candidates would mention such mechanisms as catalysing the formation of plasmin from plasmingoen, activation of endogenous plasminogen and direct conversion of plasminogen to plasmin."
- "This question was also best answered using a structured response and illustrations."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Discussion and/or diagrams of the process of formation of temporary platelet plug and conversion to a definitive haemostatic plug after injury to the vessel wall, showing the Intrinsic, Extrinsic and Common Pathways with note of essential cofactors (tissue thromboplastin, Ca++) and fibrinolysis and clot resolution, inhibitors and controlers that prevent excessive coagulation. The latter would lead into outlining the mechanism of thrombolytics."
