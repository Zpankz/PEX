title: "Describe the underlying principles involved in the measurement of end tidal CO2 (by infrared analysis), including sources of error and interference."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2010
sitting: A
question: 04
passRate: 10
lo:
- "[[R2d]]"
- "[[S2g]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to at least mention and describe the following points – absorption at the infrared spectrum; Beer-Lambert Law and it’s relevance to measurement of ETCO2; sources of error (effect of other gases, atmospheric pressure), sources of interference (gas sampling methods, heating), calibration, features of the sampling chamber that may cause error (glass construction, size), sampling rates, etc."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Answers provided by candidates lacked breadth and depth, indicated that there was generally a poor understanding of this topic."
- "The usual mistake was to discuss the clinical reasons behind the reading not reflecting the PaCO2 rather than sources of error of the end tidal CO2."
- "Candidates should review this topic from the references from which the answer was sought and texts included as recommended reading."
