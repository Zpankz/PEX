title: "Describe the production and metabolism of lactate."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2010
sitting: A
question: 05
passRate: 50
lo:
- "[[K2g]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to further describe this physiological processes."
- "A good answered required quantification of lactate production during normal aerobic metabolism, during anaeorobic metabolism, the pathways involved (Glucose to Pyruvate, Pyruvate to Citric Acid cycle in presence of Oxygen, Pyruvate + NADH to Lactate + NAD+ without Oxygen) associated ATP production, site of intracellular production, why red blood cells differ and lactate metabolism (eg oxidation to pyruvate by well-oxygenated muscle cells which is then directly used to fuel the citric acid cycle conversion to glucose via the Cori cycle in the liver through the process of gluconeogenesis)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good answers illustrated the loss of energy potential with the production of lactate and discussed the situations that would lead to an inbalance between production and metabolism of lactate."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates who did poorly in this question did so due to a lack of depth and breadth for this topic."
- "For example, even though the Cori Cycle was often mentioned, it was poorly described in relation to lactate metabolism."
