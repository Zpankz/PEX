entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2024
sitting: A
question: 4
passRate: 73
EC_expectedDomains:
- "the principles of haemodialysis, solute movement across a semipermeable membrane by diffusion and its dependency on the solute characteristics (size, charge, protein binding, volume of distribution) the dialysis membrane properties (porosity, thickness, surface area), the concentration gradient of substance in dialysate to blood and the rate of solute delivery (blood flow vs dialysate rate)"
- "Haemofiltration, solute movement across semipermeable membrane by diffusion and required a discussion of the effect of transmembrane pressure, blood flow, effluent/ultrafiltration rate, plasma oncotic pressure, solute concentration in plasma water and the Sieving coefficient on the clearance."
- "a brief representation of the substances found in renal replacement fluids including major electrolytes at near physiological concentrations (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate) and when these might be varied i.e. no calcium in citrate anticoagulation, less potassium in hyperkalaemia"
- "the inclusion of a buffer (such as bicarbonate, lactate or citrate), water and the absence of colloid"
