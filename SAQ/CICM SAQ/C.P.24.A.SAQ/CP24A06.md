sitting: A
question: 6
passRate: 3
EC_expectedDomains:
- "knowledge of the fibrinolytic pathway with details of the relevant mediators and inhibitors"
- "knowledge of both the coagulation cascade and fibrinolysis, with detail of how the pathways are simultaneously activated by the same stimuli to ensure balance between bleeding and clotting"
- "a detailed description of the mechanism of action of alteplase, recombinant t-PA"
EC_extraCredit:
- "A comparison to endogenous t-PA helped illustrate this action and the subsequent bleeding and the non-bleeding effects."
