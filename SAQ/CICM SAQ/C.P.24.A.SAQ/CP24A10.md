title: "(a) Explain the excitation contraction mechanism as it relates to the smooth muscle of the myometrium including a gravid uterus (50% of marks). (b) For each tocolytic agent: salbutamol, nifedipine, magnesium sulphate, provide the following information: - (i) List the class (10% of marks) - (ii) Provide a dose (10% of marks) - (iii) Describe the mechanism of action (20% of marks) - (iv) Outline the adverse effects (10% of marks)"

EC_expectedDomains:
- "the process of contraction in smooth muscle, as well as specific information pertaining to the smooth muscle of the uterus"
- "stimuli for contraction (i.e., hormones such as oxytocin, oestrogen, and prostaglandins and stretch); possessing an unstable membrane potential which plays a greater role than nervous input; as well as the uterus smooth muscle functioning as a syncytia and having baseline tone"
- "the key steps of contraction (influx of calcium, formation of calcium-calmodulin formation, activation of MLCK, creation of myosin-actin cross bridges with utilisation of ATP) are those generic to any smooth muscle"
- "relating the mechanism of action specifically to the uterus"
- "specific unwanted effects relevant to use as a tocolytic e.g., foetal tachycardia for salbutamol as result of crossing the placenta"
- "doses for these drugs when used as a tocolytic, as opposed to for other indications (i.e., salbutamol infusion rather than nebulised)"
EC_extraCredit:
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Descriptions of striated muscle did not attract marks."
- "A description or explanation was required rather than a list of steps (e.g., the sources of calcium rather than a simple statement of calcium influx occurring)."
