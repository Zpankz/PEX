entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2024
sitting: A
question: 15
passRate: 56
EC_expectedDomains:
- "normal range, how and why the value is affected by liver failure and potential con-founders"
- "in the case of albumin; the normal range is 35-50g/L; it is produced in the liver and thus the measured value will decrease in synthetic liver dysfunction; the half life of albumin is long (20 days) and therefore it is a better marker of chronic dysfunction; potential con-founders include inflammation (negative phase protein), malnutrition and increased loss (nephrotic syndrome etc)"

EC_errorsCommon:
