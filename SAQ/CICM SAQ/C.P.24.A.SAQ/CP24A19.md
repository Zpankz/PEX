EC_expectedDomains:
- "amiodarone's action at K+, Na+, B and Ca channels, including second messenger systems and effects on SA/AV and myocyte action potential"
- "the mechanism of metabolism, presence (or absence) of active metabolites and organs involved in clearance with rough figures for half life, Vd, loading dose and clearance values"
EC_extraCredit:
- "It is recommended to include the mechanisms by which side effects occur rather than just listing them."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Simply stating that there is hepatic metabolism and renal excretion is not enough information for pharmacokinetics"
