entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2024
sitting: A
question: 14
passRate: 62
EC_expectedDomains:
- "list of the normal values for cerebral blood flow including differential flow to grey and white matter"
- "an answer structured around the cerebral perfusion/cerebral vascular resistance formula"
- "Factors influencing flow include autoregulation of pressure (via the myogenic reflex), metabolic autoregulation and local acidity, arterial levels of CO2 and O2, temperature and a minor role for the sympathetic nervous system"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Many answers were augmented effectively with graphs of cerebral blood flow versus CPP, PaO2 and PaCO2."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A detailed discussed of ICP and factors effecting this was not required."
