EC_expectedDomains:
- "detailed description of the ionic events of the phases of the sino-atrial node AP"
- "detailed explanation of impulse propagation both between cardiac myocytes and across the myocardium"
- "Safety mechanisms to be mentioned included anatomical insulation, refractory periods and rate"
EC_extraCredit:
- "A diagram of the sino-atrial node potential which included the phases and labelled x and y axis was helpful in this description."
- "Some comparison with other cardiac action potentials added depth to answers, as did a brief description of the influences on the action potential such as the autonomic nervous system."
