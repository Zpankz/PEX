EC_expectedDomains:
- "definition of a receptor as a protein/glycoprotein that undergoes a conformational change upon ligand binding"
- "overview of where these are found and the mechanisms of activation/downstream processing"
- "definition of each type (agonist, antagonist, partial agonist and inverse agonist) was expected with reference to the intrinsic activity at the receptor and the affinity for the receptor"
- "law of mass action (D+R=DR) and how this equilibrium is altered by each"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Concepts such as reversible and irreversible binding and its implications as well as competitive and non-competitive antagonism"
