entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM

sitting: A
question: 3
passRate: 11
EC_expectedDomains:
- "information on immediate changes in LV Volumes and Pressures"
- "how compensatory mechanisms largely within the LV itself eventually lead to restoration of stroke volume"
- "description of the Frank Starling mechanism, baroreceptor reflex and anrep effect"
- "effect of increased SVR on LV myocardial work and oxygen consumption and coronary perfusion"
EC_extraCredit:
EC_errorsCommon:
- "focusing on definitions and determinants of SVR"
- "providing LV PV loops without relating this to the situation of an increased SVR or without adequately labelling or explaining what they were demonstrating with the graph"
