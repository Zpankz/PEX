EC_expectedDomains:
- "definition of venous admixture"
- "detail on the sources including anatomical (including atelectasis/closing capacity) and V/Q Mismatch or Scatter"
- "the effect supplemental oxygen on the many causes of arterial hypoxaemia to be explained"
- "effect that this has on areas of true shunt and different degrees of shunt fraction and also on V/Q scatter"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Information for this can be found on Nunn's Respiratory Physiology."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "V/Q Scatter was commonly omitted from answers."
- "The use of the verb 'describe' implies that further details are required beyond a simple list of the sources (such as a description of their mechanism and relative importance)."
