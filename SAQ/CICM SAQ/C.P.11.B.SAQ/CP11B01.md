EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected answers would include a comment this would transiently increase the blood glucose and result in the stimulation of insulin production."
- "Some detail was then required on the mechanism by which insulin production is increased and time frames over which this occurred, as well as mechanism by which glucose passes through to the urine."
- "Other important points expected were the fate of glucose, once taken up by the cells, the inhibitory effects (and mechanisms) of insulin (ie inhibits glycogenolysis, triglyceride and protein breakdown, etc)."
- "A description of the physiological consequences of increased insulin production was required."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates who did poorly did so due to a lack of detail and understanding of the topic."
