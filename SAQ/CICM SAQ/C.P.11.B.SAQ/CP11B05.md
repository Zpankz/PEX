title: "Describe the essential components of an ECG monitor (60% marks). Outline the methods employed to reduce artefact (40% marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2011
sitting: B
question: 5
passRate: 8
EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answer it was expected that mention would be made of what an ECG monitors does (ie detects and amplifies the small electrical changes on the skin that are caused when the heart muscle depolarizes), how (ie use of 2 or more electrodes, typically being made of silver or silver chloride), the type of leads (ie unipolar and bipolar, and a description of the latter), the way the signal is handled (isolation, amplification, gain, filtering) and displayed."
- "Methods to reduce artefact and improve signal:noise ratio, should have included skin conductive measures, minimising external interference (filters, earthing), common mode signal artefact rejection, high input impedance amplification and mention of diagnostic and monitoring modes."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Unfortunately candidates have performed poorly in this question, as they have in previous measurement and monitoring questions."
- "Future candidates need to be aware that such questions WILL get asked again."
