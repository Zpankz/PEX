EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answer candidates were expected to mention that there were “essential” and “nonessential proteins”, that protein synthesis draws on amino acids sourced from the common amino acid pool (because there is no cellular storage of amino acids) which is the combination of amino acids derived from gut absorption of digested dietary protein and also the continuous turnover of endogenous protein, amino acids filtered via the glomerulus are reabsorbed within the renal tubule and that in health losses are minor, but increases with illness."
- "Protein synthesis is a semicontinuous activity, the rate of which varies considerably between cells under the influence of factors neuro- endocrine factors, substrate availability and energy availability."
- "Proteolysis occurs within nuclear and cytoplasmic proteasomes, via peptide bond disruption catalysed by proteases, which are then processed further into amino acids being then available for release into the amino acid pool or utilised immediately for protein synthesis."
- "In relation to starvation candidates were expected to mention that it results from a severe ongoing restriction of protein, energy and nutrient intake."
- "That initially, glycogen stores from the liver and skeletal muscle are utilised after conversion to glucose and provide energy, thus sparing of fat and protein stores from use as an energy source for a period of less than a day, following which fats are increasingly utilised and finally protein catabolism accelerates, especially from the liver and skeletal muscle, with relative sparing of the heart and brain."
