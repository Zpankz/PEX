title: "Discuss the regulation of cardiac output. Illustrate your answer by using a graph to describe the important physiological relationships."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2011
sitting: B
question: 13
passRate: 44
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Important was the concept that at rest cardiac output is controlled almost entirely by peripheral factors that determine venous return."
- "These concepts were best illustrated by graphing vascular function (venous return vs right atrial pressure) and cardiac function (cardiac output vs right atrial pressure) curves."
- "Then demonstrating on these curves the factors that affected preload, contractility and afterload such as changes in blood volume, sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation and exercise as examples."
- "Also important to demonstrate on these curves was the fact that venous return and cardiac output are equal at steady state."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most candidates approached this question by defining cardiac output as stroke volume Ã— heart rate and then discussing the determinants of cardiac output - preload, contractility, afterload and heart rate rather than focusing on the regulation of cardiac output."
- "Under preload a brief description of the Frank Starling mechanism was required."
- "Candidates who took this approach were not penalised, if there were clear, correct diagrams with explanations indicating comprehension of these concepts."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "On the whole graphs were poorly drawn and were not well integrated into the answer."
- "Some candidates also wasted time by unnecessarily describing excitation-contraction coupling and sympathetic nerve reflex pathways."
