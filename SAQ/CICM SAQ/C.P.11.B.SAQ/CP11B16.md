title: "Using a diagram, explain the effect of PaO2, PaCO2 and MAP (mean arterial pressure) on cerebral blood flow (60% marks). Outline the effects of propofol and ketamine on cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic requirement for oxygen (CMRO2), and cerebral venous oxygen saturation (40% marks)."

passRate: 44
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Mention of factors that affected, and regulation of, the MAP vs CBF graph was expected in order to pass this question well."
- "The effect of propofol and ketamine on the CBF was well answered."
- "Propofol and ketamine have an opposite effect on cerebral haemodynamic and metabolic rate."
- "Propofol produces a dose dependent reduction in CBF with proportionate reduction in CMRO2, and thus a minimal change in cerebral venous O2 Sat."
- "Propofol doesnâ€™t affect the autoregulatory curve of CBF and the PaCO2 response."
- "Ketamine produce a dose dependent increase in CBF and a mild increase in CMRO2."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Graphical depictions of the effect of Mean Arterial Pressure, oxygen tension and carbon dioxide tension on cerebral blood flow were common and in general accurate."
