title: "Describe the role of the kidney in drug excretion and the factors affecting this (60% marks). Briefly outline how you would alter the dosing of a drug with high renal excretion in a patient with renal impairment (40% marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2011
sitting: B
question: 3
passRate: 52
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected candidates would expand on the role of the kidney in the excretion of drugs and metabolites."
- "A statement that referred to the classical features of drugs that undergo renal excretion (eg polarity, lipid solubility, size and protein binding, drug metabolites) and a definition of renal clearance was expected and would have provided an excellent introduction to any answer."
- "It was then expected that candidates would mention, in some detail, the processes of filtration and secretion (both active and passive and both proximal and distal along the renal tubules)."
- "The question also asked for factors that affect renal drug excretion, for example, a reduction in GFR or alteration in protein binding."
- "An approach to alterations of dosing would require some consideration of assessing degree of dysfunction (GFR estimation / calculation) then an understanding that it would not impact on loading doses but would influence subsequent dosing of renal cleared drugs."
- "Plasma monitoring provides useful information for some drugs, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index."
