title: "Outline the functional anatomy, and the physiological factors, that determine oxygen delivery to the renal medulla."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2011
sitting: B
question: 21
passRate: 4
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A good answer required mentioning factors that affect systemic oxygen capacity and delivery (eg Hb, cardiac output, PaO2, etc), Hb-HBO2 dissociation and a description of the anatomy and regulation of renal medullary blood flow."
- "20 – 30% of nephrons have glomeruli deep in the cortex and long Loop of Henle that go deep into medulla."
- "Here blood supply differs – long efferent arterioles from glomeruli into outer medulla and inner cortex that then divide into vasa recta deep in medulla."
- "These vessels carry post glomerular blood so have less serum, mostly plasma, ie more viscous and concentrated."
- "Factors that influence medullary blood flow include: Sympathetic stimulation – decrease (via efferent arteriolar constriction), Angiotensin II (via tubuloglomerular feedback) – decrease (via efferent arteriolar constriction), Endothelin – decrease (via efferent arteriolar constriction), Prostaglandins – increase, Bradykinin – increase, high protein meal – increase, high glucose levels – increase."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates performed poorly due to a lack of knowledge of the topic and/or failure to logically present their answer."
- "Common mistakes were to give no value for renal blood flow, to discuss the function of the medulla which was not required and to not describe the factors that influence medullary blood flow."
