- "For a good answer candidates were expected to give a description of the lower oesophageal sphincter (the intrinsic and extrinsic sphincters and flap-valve), that it maintains a resting pressure of 15-25 mmHg above gastric pressure which prevents gastro-oesophageal reflux, which relaxes after swallowing, that the resting tone is maintained by myogenic and neurogenic mechanisms and the effects of hormones upon the sphincter (ie gastrin, motilin and Î± adrenergic stimulation increases and secretin, glucagon, VIP and GIP decrease tone)."
