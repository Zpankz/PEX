title: "Describe the physiology of the Renin and Angiotensin system."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2011
sitting: B
question: 6
passRate: 60
EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answer, candidates were expected to mention what renin and angiotensin are and what they do, as well as briefly mention the place of angiotensin converting enzyme (converts Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II and inactivates bradykinin)."
- "Renin is a proteolytic enzyme cleaves angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, secreted by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney which are located in media of afferent arteriole and in close proximity to the glomerulus and the distal convoluted tubule (macula densa)."
- "Angiotensin II acts on cell surface AT1 and AT2 receptors."
- "Major functions being to preserve of GFR & enhanced Na/H2O reabsorption in the setting of reduced renal blood flow (candidates expected to outline the mechanism by which this occurs), vasoconstriction, stimulate aldosterone secretion and increase thirst and ADH secretion."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The better candidates also mentioned that it decreases sensitivity of baroreceptor reflex, increases secretion of ACTH and facilitates noradrenaline release from sympathetic nervous system as well as its fate (metabolized by blood/tissue peptidases)."
- "A good response for regulation would have been mentioning principally regulated via renin and angiotensin."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "It is unfortunate that many candidates presenting to this examination are not able to provide sufficient information for a pass."
