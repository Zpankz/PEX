college: CICM
year: 2011
sitting: B
question: 17
passRate: 36
EC_expectedDomains:
- "However, the comparison of the pharmacology of nimodipine and verapamil was in general answered poorly."
- "Mode of action was well answered, but important principles relating to pharmacokinetics (such as a basic outline of protein binding, bioavailability, and metabolism) were expected, but common omissions."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most candidates were able to classify the calcium channel blockers well (Type I : Phenylalkylamines eg verapamil, Type II : Dihydropyridines eg nimodipine and Type III : Benzothiazepines eg diltiazem)"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Few candidates demonstrated an organised approach to this part of the question."
- "The two drugs’ presentation, routes of administration, indications and dosing were poorly answered considering that nimodipine in particular is used frequently in intensive care units."
- "More knowledge than ‘metabolism in the liver’ is required."
- "Few candidates mentioned interactions, adverse effects, or predictable effects of over dosage of these drugs."
