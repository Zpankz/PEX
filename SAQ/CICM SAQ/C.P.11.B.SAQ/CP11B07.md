title: "Define lung compliance (30% marks). Describe how is it measured (70% marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2011
sitting: B
question: 7
passRate: 36
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Easy marks were to be gained purely by mentioning that compliance is defined by ∆V/∆P, the ∆P being the gradient from alveolar – intrapleural, normal values, static and dynamic compliance."
- "Good answers would then include a mention of how static and dynamic compliance is measured (specifically how volume and pressures are measured."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This is a core area of physiology that relates to everyday Intensive Care practice, thus it was expected that more than the observed number of candidates would have scored well."
- "Candidates performed poorly purely from a lack of sufficient knowledge."
