- "A portal system is an arrangement by which blood collected from one set of capillaries passes through a large vessel or vessels, to another set of capillaries before returning to the systemic circulation."
- "The three portal systems are the 1) system of blood vessels that link the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary in the brain, which allows endocrine communication between the two structures. 2) within the liver, whereby venous blood from the GI tract drains into the superior and inferior mesenteric veins; these two vessels are then joined by the splenic vein to form the portal vein which enters the liver, drains into the hepatic sinusoids and then eventually into the hepatic veins which join the inferior vena cava, with the purpose of defending against by breaking down and metabolising most of what has been absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (including an immunoprotective action). 3) within the kidney, whereby blood from the afferent arterioles enters the glomerulus (first capillary network), followed by the efferent arterioles, then the peritubular network (second capillary network) and eventually the venous system, with the purpose of stronger re-absorptive capacity for water from within long Loops of Henle that go deep within the renal medulla."
