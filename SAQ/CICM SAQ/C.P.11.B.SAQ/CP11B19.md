EC_expectedDomains:
- "Type I error is: known as α and is when you incorrectly reject the null hypothesis – that is say a difference exists when it actually doesn’t."
- "Type II error is: when you incorrectly accept the null hypothesis, is termed β, that is to say no difference exists when it actually does."
- "The point estimate: Is a single value estimate of a population parameter."
- "It represents a descriptive statistic for a summary measure, or a measure of central tendency from a given population sample."
- "Confidence intervals: define a range of values that are likely to include a population parameter."
- "They are derived from the standard error for a given population."
- "The percentage given, eg. 95 % reflects the probability that the true value will be contained within that interval."
- "Power is the likelihood of detecting a specified difference if it exists."
- "It is important as it is a key determinant of the Sample size required for a study and this is a vital aspect of experimental design and evaluation."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most candidates correctly distinguished between a type 1 and type 2 errors."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Few candidates gave a definition for power or a value."
