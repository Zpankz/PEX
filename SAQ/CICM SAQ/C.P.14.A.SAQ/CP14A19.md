title: "Define cardiac output. (10% of marks) Outline the factors that affect cardiac output. (60% of marks) Briefly describe the thermo dilution method of measuring cardiac output. (30% of marks)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2014
sitting: A
question: 19
passRate: 58
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected candidates could provide a definition (heart rate x stroke volume) and then move on to outline factors that affect it (afterload, preload, contractility)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for descriptions of the relationship to mean systemic filling pressure and other influences beyond this."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates described a thermodilution cardiac output curve but almost all described the technique as based on the “Fick equation or method” (which is used to estimate cardiac output from oxygen consumption)."
- "Very few candidates correctly identified the Stewart Hamilton equation as the integration method used to relate cardiac output (flow) to temperature change as an example of indicator dye dilution."
- "Candidates seemed to lack depth and understanding on this topic."
