EC_errorsCommon:
- "Few candidates mentioned anatomical variations."
- "Many answers had no identifiable structure and went back and forth around the topic as information came to mind."
- "A number of answers contained very rough diagrams that did not contain mark worthy information but took time to draw."
- "Many candidates ignored or forgot about this part of the question."
- "Some candidates wrote 2 or more pages of significant detail in stark contrast to what they had written for the first part of the question."
- "The percentage of marks allocated is a good guide as to the level of detail required in the answer."
