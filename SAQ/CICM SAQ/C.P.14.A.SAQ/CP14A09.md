sitting: A
question: 09
passRate: 16
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected that the direction of an effect would be clearly indicated (e.g. “potency” would not score a mark unless the candidate wrote – “low potency increases speed of onset”, etc.)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A good answer would include a list of these factors, with a brief explanation."
- "Mention of other factors such as electrolyte disturbances gained additional marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Speed of onset is related to how quickly an effective dose reaches the neuromuscular junction, the type of interaction with the receptor and the margin of safety of the receptors."
- "Examples of parameters that increase speed of onset include a high drug rate of delivery (high CO, high muscle group blood flow, and fast injection rate), high drug concentration (higher dose, low potency, higher ED 95, lower protein binding) or a depolarising block."
- "These drugs are charged molecules which do not cross cell membranes and have a low volume of distribution. Absorption from GIT, Lipid solubility, pKa, metabolism and clearance have minimal relevance to speed of onset."
