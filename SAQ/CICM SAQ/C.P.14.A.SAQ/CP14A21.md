- ""
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most candidates were able to provide some details about warfarin"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "however dabigatran was less well known."
- "The syllabus provides a guide to depth of knowledge required for listed drugs and so more detail was expected for Warfarin as a class “A” drug than was expected for dabigatran (a class “C” drug)."
- "It was however expected that candidates would provide more than just generalisations regarding “hepatic metabolism and renal excretion” when applied to both agents that actually have different modes of elimination."
