college: CICM

sitting: A
question: 07
passRate: 34
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Explanation of several crucial principles was expected for a good answer."
- "These would include that Haemoglobin can be measured and quantified with a light absorbance technique; based on the Beer Lambert law (a description of this was required)."
- "In addition, oxygenated haemoglobin must be distinguished from reduced haemoglobin (the 2 dominant species of Hb) and that the oximeter determines pulsatile from non pulsatile blood."
- "The oximeter accounts for ambient light and that “R”, a ratio of absorbances during pulsatile and non pulsatile blood is calculated and compared within a computer algorithm to standardised values of SaO2 to deliver a final value."
- "Mention of limitations was not required except to answer the second part of question."
EC_extraCredit:
- ""
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common omissions included failure to describe accurately the Beer Lambert Law, and no explanation of how pulsatile component was detected, or ambient light accounted for."
- "Many candidates understood the clinical inaccuracy associated with CO and Met HB, but failed to identify the spectrophotometric reason and application of the R value for this discrepancy."
