EC_expectedDomains:
- "The structure for answering a pharmacology question was often poor and there was commonly a lack of precision in pharmacokinetics. We suggest that candidates look at a general pharmacokinetic structure when answering these questions. One approach would be a structure that covers drug name and description, pharmaceutics (chemistry/ ampoule contents), Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics (Think CNS/CVS/Resp/GIT etc. if relevant), Dose and Side effects then Indications and Contraindications can help organize the information."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most candidates managed to provide a classification of calcium anatagonists."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The pharmacology of verapamil was less well understood."
