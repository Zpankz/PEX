title: "Describe the effects of resonance and damping on an invasive arterial blood pressure tracing."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2015
sitting: A
question: 12
passRate: 33
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected that candidates could describe that the arterial pressure waveform is made up of many different sine waves (as determined by Fourier Analysis) with each sine wave having a specific frequency."
- "Every system has its own natural oscillatory frequency, or resonant frequency."
- "Some damping is inherent in any system and acts to slow down the rate of change of signal between the patient and pressure transducer."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Accurate graphical representations of invasive pressure traces are important."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates provided poor drawings without axis, labels, reference to normal or discussion in text."
- "The effect of damping on temporal response was rarely mentioned."
