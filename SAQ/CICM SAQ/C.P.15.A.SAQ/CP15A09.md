title: "Classify and describe mechanisms of drug interactions with examples."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2015
sitting: A
question: 9
passRate: 33
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question was best approached by classifying drug interactions as physicochemical or pharmaceutical, then pharmacokinetic and finally pharmacodynamic."
- "Pharmacokinetic drug interactions could then be further sub classified into those affecting the rate and extent of absorption of other drugs by mechanisms such as surface adsorption, chelation, altering gastric pH and altering gastrointestinal motility."
- "Drug interactions affecting the distribution of drugs mainly involve competition for protein binding and the displacement of highly protein bound drugs."
- "Drug metabolism interactions usually involve drug induction or inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes either increasing or decreasing the metabolism of other drugs."
- "Examples of drug interactions affecting drug excretion include drugs altering urinary pH or drugs altering the tubular rate of secretion of other drugs."
- "Pharmacodynamic drug interactions include potentiation of one drug by another, antagonism and combined toxicity at the tissue level."
- "Combined toxicity can be due to the potentiation of adverse effects of two drugs."
EC_extraCredit:
- "This is a broad question with plenty of opportunity to score marks."
- "A structured approach such as that described above and providing an example for each mechanism was important."
