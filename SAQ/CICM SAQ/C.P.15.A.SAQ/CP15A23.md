entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2015
sitting: A
question: 23
passRate: 8
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The first question required a definition of mean, median and mode and some explanation about when the use of one would be preferred over another."
- "A list of measures with a sentence or equation describing each would have scored well."
- "The list could have included range, interquartile range (and box and whisper plots), mean absolute deviation, variance and standard deviation and coefficient of variation."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates confused standard deviation and standard error of the mean and many candidates failed to discuss ranges which are the simplest way to describe dispersion."
- "Not all measures needed to be discussed to pass the question."
