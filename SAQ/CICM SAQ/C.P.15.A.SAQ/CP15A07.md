title: "Outline the physiological responses to the rapid intravenous administration of 1 litre of 0.9 % saline to a 70 kg euvolaemic person."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2015
sitting: A
question: 7
passRate: 33
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to outline these changes, their effector responses (e.g. autonomic nervous system reflexes and humoral changes) and their physiological consequences."
- "Candidates were expected to briefly describe this effect as well as the subsequent management of the sodium and water load by the kidney."
- "This question is best answered using a time-based approach."
- "For example, upon the rapid infusion of a litre of normal saline there will be a brief period of hypervolemia, increase in arterial blood pressure and an associated physiological reflex response to these changes (e.g. baroreceptors, atrial stretch receptors, etc.)."
- "There will also be an associated increase in renal perfusion and stimulation of intrarenal receptors (e.g. juxtaglomerular apparatus)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most candidates spoke about the pressure effects, and only some compared these with the volume effects."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The effect of redistribution and other effects were not considered by the majority of the candidates."
- "Answering this question required the integration of information from areas of cardiovascular, body fluid and renal physiology which proved difficult for most candidates."
