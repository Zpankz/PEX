title: "Describe the mechanisms by which water and electrolytes are reabsorbed across the renal tubules."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2015
sitting: A
question: 4
passRate: 33
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected the answer would talk about transport “mechanisms” across membranes."
- "These would include processes such as reabsorption, diffusion, facilitated diffusion, primary and secondary active transport, endocytosis, osmosis and solvent drag."
- "The intent of the question was to have the candidate describe in the context of a classification the mechanisms by which water and electrolytes may cross a cell membrane and use the renal tubule to provide an example of each mechanism."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates used colloquial and vague language to describe precise concepts."
- "Some candidates structured their answer as an outline of the principal mechanisms at each segment of the tubule. Thus there was repetitive reference to mechanisms without a description as requested in the question. This approach also resulted in some candidates omitting some mechanisms altogether."
