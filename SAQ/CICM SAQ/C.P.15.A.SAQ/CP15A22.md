EC_extraCredit:
- "The better answers were in a table format."
- "Noting dexmedetomidine is metabolised to inactive metabolites and ketamine is metabolised to norketamine gained marks, specific pathways were not required."
- "When comparing two drugs it would be useful to note that though they both provide sedation with analgesia they are used in different circumstances."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The pharmacokinetic information required was not detailed but only minimal marks can be awarded for ‘administered IV with 100% bioavailability, liver metabolism and renal excretion’ which was a common answer."
- "The pharmacodynamic effects often omitted the cardiovascular and respiratory effects of ketamine (particularly bronchodilation)."
