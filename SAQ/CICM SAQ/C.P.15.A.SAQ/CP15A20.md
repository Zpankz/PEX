EC_expectedDomains:
- "A definition of the sympathetic system, followed by a systematic description of the central sympathetic centres; what happens at the spinal cord; the anatomy of the pre and post ganglionic fibres would have been awarded with a pass mark."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional information about the sympathetic ganglia and the neurotransmitters involved would have rounded off a good answer."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many answers lacked anatomical detail and described the actions (function) of the sympathetic system which was not asked for."
- "Most answers lacked any structure."
- "The most common reason for not passing this question was that significant sections of the anatomy from central to peripheral were not mentioned."
