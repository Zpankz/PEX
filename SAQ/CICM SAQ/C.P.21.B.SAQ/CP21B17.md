- "Excellent answers described the function of the ECG device and its components. Components include electrodes, which form leads (unipolar and bipolar), the amplifier and an output device. The process of amplification and filtering (e.g., high and low pass filters), as well as monitoring and diagnostic ECG modes were described. A comprehensive list of ways to reduce artefacts, including strategies to address both patient and equipment factors was generally provided."
