EC_expectedDomains:
- "This was a new question and overall, most candidates provided some detail on each component as requested. Those answers that used a simple template for each section generally scored better than those who wrote in a paragraph style for each section."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Areas expected to be covered included the following; a definition of the variable to provide context, a normal value and the range of influences that effect the variable both related to liver function and or extrinsic to the liver (attempting to introduce the concepts of sensitivity and specificity for each test)."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Stronger answers provided some context as to whether the variable was sensitive to acute or chronic changes in liver function and which synthetic/metabolic component of the liver the variable represented."
