- "This question exposed an area of the syllabus neglected by the candidates. Answers were generally vague in detail with lots of incorrect facts and generally displayed a very limited knowledge. Antifungal agents are regularly used in critically ill patients either as treatment or prophylaxis. An understanding of the aspects of these drugs with respect to spectrum of activity, mechanism of action, specific PK and PD properties as well as potential side effects would have been the basis for this compare and contrast question. Examiners want to be convinced that the candidates understand the strengths and weaknesses of each drug and in which circumstances one agent might be used in preference to the other."
