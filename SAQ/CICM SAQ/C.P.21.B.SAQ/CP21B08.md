EC_errorsCommon:
- "The overall pass rate for this question was poor considering how relevant this area of anatomy is in our daily practice. Better scoring answers used a template including a general description, origin, course and relations, tributaries and as requested in this question, the surface anatomy. Many answers that scored poorly only provided the briefest detail, were vague in their descriptions and incorrect with respect to the facts presented or imprecise with respect to the terminology used."
