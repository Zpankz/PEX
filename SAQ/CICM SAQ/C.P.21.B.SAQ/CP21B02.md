title: "Describe the pharmacology of lidoocaine."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2021
sitting: B
question: 2
passRate: 71
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The answers for this question were generally of a good standard. Lidocaine is a core drug in intensive care practice and thus a high level of detail was expected. This question was best structured using a standard pharmacology template (pharmaceutics, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics)."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A small number of answers omitted any pharmaceutic elements. Another common error was the use of vague statements. For example, many answers stated that the maximum dose (without adrenaline) is 3 mg/kg, without specifying that this is subcutaneous."
- "The concept of the ratio of the dose required to produce cardiovascular collapse to that required to induce seizures (CC/CNS ratio) was often mentioned. However, in many cases this was conveyed simply as an abbreviated statement without any additional explanation leaving the examiner unsure as to whether the candidate understood the concept (and thus unable to award any additional marks). In addition, many candidates confused the order of this ratio (incorrectly referring to it as a CNS/CC ratio of 7). Lastly, few answers made specific mention of the narrow therapeutic index and the associated implications for use in the ICU."
