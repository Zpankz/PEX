EC_expectedDomains:
- "The question asked for a detailed account of the side effects of amiodarone, hence those candidates that just provided a list or outline scored less well. It was expected that candidates provide some detail of the side effect. Answers that scored well prioritised those relevant to ICU clinical practice."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many provided disorganised outlines of the side effects and frequently the cardiovascular side effects were poorly explained. Many candidates omitted the important drug interactions of amiodarone use and few candidates related the side effect profile to the duration of treatment."
