title: "Explain the physiological factors that affect airway resistance."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2021
sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 31
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected candidates cover the breadth of the factors that affect airway resistance. Generally, as a concept the type of flow (laminar vs turbulent) was answered well by most candidates, however many failed to mention the other factors that affect airway resistance."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Airway diameter as a primary determinant of airway resistance was commonly omitted. Better answers which covered the factors affecting airway diameter classified them broadly and included examples such as physical compression/external obstruction, broncho-motor tone and local cellular mechanisms. Some answers did not explain these factors in enough detail and often with incorrect facts."
