title: "Describe the factors that affect mixed venous oxygen saturation."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2021
sitting: B
question: 13
passRate: 49
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Mixed venous oxygen saturation is used as a surrogate marker for the overall balance between oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption. A good answer stated this, described the importance of where it is measured and went on to describe the various factors that affect oxygen delivery and consumption. Descriptions of the factors that affect oxygen saturation of haemoglobin, partial pressure of oxygen in the blood and position of oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve were necessary to score well."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Important omissions were factors that increased and decreased oxygen consumption. While many candidates were able to correctly write the equations for oxygen content and oxygen flux, they then failed to describe how the variables within these equations were related to mixed venous oxygen saturation."
