EC_expectedDomains:
- "Although the pass rate for this question was reasonably high the examiners commented on a lack of detailed knowledge within most answers for such a core component of our daily practice."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Several candidates failed to provide a normal value and only few provided anything other than 5l/min. There was a general lack of detail, and at times, some confusion about the Frank Starling effect. Most candidates outlined the major determinants of stroke volume, although many were light on the determinants of each or incorporated incorrect facts. Several candidates did not mention HR as a determinant of CO."
