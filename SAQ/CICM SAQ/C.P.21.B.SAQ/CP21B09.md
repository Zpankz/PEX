EC_expectedDomains:
- "This was a two-part question with marks and thus timing of the answers given as a percentage. There are generally many ways to classify drugs within the same class. These are usually well described in the relevant recommended pharmacological texts."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Receptor distribution throughout the body and the effect of the drug-receptor interaction are useful ways to organise systemic pharmacodynamic responses, as opposed to a list of organ systems with associated vague statements of interaction."
