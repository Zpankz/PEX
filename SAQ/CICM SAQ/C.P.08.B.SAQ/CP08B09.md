title: "Describe the physiological consequences that follow an intravenous bolus of 50mls of 50% glucose."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 09
passRate: 20
EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good pass the main areas that required description included: The transient glycosuria, The mechanism and time course of the biphasic release of insulin from pancreatic cells, The mechanism of the trapping of glucose within liver cells, The multiple actions of insulin which include inhibiting glycogenolysis and promoting glycgogen synthesis in the liver, promoting the uptake of glucose by muscle, fat and other cells, increasing the metabolism of glucose to fatty acids and triglycerides, inhibiting triglyceride breakdown and promoting protein synthesis."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional marks were awarded for details of where these actions of insulin occurred and the enzymes that were stimulated or inhibited by insulin."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some candidates stated that this bolus of hypertonic glucose would produce a significant and prolonged increase in plasma osmolarity and then went on to produce detailed descriptions of the thirst and ADH mechanisms."
- "In fact with a normal insulin response glucose is rapidly cleared from the blood."
