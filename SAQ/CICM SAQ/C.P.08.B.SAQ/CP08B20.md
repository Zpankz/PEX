entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 20
passRate: 80
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected candidates would address specific aspects of pharmacology such as action, mechanism of action, half life and duration of effect, route of administration, potential toxicity and special precautions."
- "Specific comments should include that both agents result in blood vessel dilation with extra credit given for detailing the differences in the balance of arterial versus venous effects between them."
- "For both agents the effect is mediated through nitric oxide and it was expected candidates would identify that nitroprusside releases NO spontaneously and GTN requires enzymatic degradation with the resultant effects on smooth muscle mediated via c GMP."
- "They are both short acting agents when used intravenously and require careful titration to measured blood pressure for effect."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra credit was given for mentioning that routes other than IV are available for GTN (topical / oral) but not for nitroprusside."
- "Comments on special precautions such as Nitroprusside should be protected from light and GTN given via non PVC giving sets gained additional marks."
- "In addition to the well described adverse effects of each agent, it was expected candidates would mention the potential for cyanide toxicity with nitroprusside and extra marks were awarded for an indication of usual doses."
EC_extraCredit:
- "These agents lend themselves to comparison and contrast as several distinct similarities and differences exist and credit was given for highlighting these."
