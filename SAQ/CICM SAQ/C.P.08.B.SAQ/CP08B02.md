title: "A published trial shows an Odds Ratio for effect of 0.88 [95% CI, 0.62 – 1.26]. Discuss your interpretation of this statistical statement."

question: 02
passRate: 20
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points expected for a pass included a discussion of how the Odds Ratio is more appropriate than Risk Ratio in a retrospective case-control study where the outcome is a rare event (<10%) and the denominator uncertain; if the outcome occurs commonly, Odds Ratio tends to overestimate risk; an Odds ratio of 1 implies no difference."
- "The use of the formula to illustrate how to calculate the confidence interval and the Standard Error assisted with explaining these terms"
EC_extraCredit:
- "The good answers mentioned the point estimate of 0.88 implied a reduction in the occurrence of the measured end point (eg mortality, a commonly measured end point)."
- "However, the trial failed to reach statistical significance because the 95% CI includes the value of 1.0 for the Odds Ratio."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A weakness amongst the candidates was a failure to provide a sufficient information on the interpretation of the data."
- "Candidates did not mention that the power of the study was not given and therefore the data could not be properly interpreted and there was no discussion on sampling errors or systemic error or bias possibly affecting the result."
