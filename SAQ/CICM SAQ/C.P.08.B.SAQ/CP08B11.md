title: "Describe the adult coronary circulation (50% of marks). Describe the physiological control of the coronary circulation (50% of marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 11
passRate: 60
EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good pass candidates were expected to cover at least the following areas Anatomy of the coronary arteries and their supply, variations in supply and venous circulation, Other unique features - coronary sinus saturation <30%, the diastolic aortic pressure, Tachycardia reduces the coronary blood flow through a reduction in diastolic time, left ventricle perfused mainly during diastole and right ventricle perfused mainly during systole, different pattern of left and right ventricular coronary perfusion (drawing a figure of Rt and Lt coronary blood flow), lack of capacity for the myocardium to increase its extraction ratio, Physiological control: The most important mechanism through which coronary blood flow can be changed is by autoregulation which changes the coronary vascular resistance to maintain constant flow in response to different coronary perfusion pressure and changing metabolic demand. Important mediators are adenosine, nitric oxide, and opening of the ATPsensitive K+ channels, prostaglandins, carbon dioxide, lactic acid or hydrogen ion. Sympathetic stimulation to heart increases coronary blood flow."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Overall the greatest deficiency by candidates was lack of detail, use of illustrations and clarity in their response."
- "It is important that candidates take note of the distribution of marks given within the question."
