exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 22
passRate: 60
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to cover the basic principles of gaseous diffusion across the placenta, with reference to: Both oxygen and carbon dioxide; Fick’s Law, including placental area and thickness, and relative gas tensions and solubilities; Changes in maternal and foetal blood flow approaching term; Approximate values for maternal and foetal gas tensions and content; The differences between foetal and maternal haemoglobin, quantitative and qualitative; The double-Bohr and double-Haldane effects; Relative maternal hyperventilation and it’s effects on arterial gas tensions and how these influence foetal transfer."
- "A good answer would also include a description of the physical arrangement of maternal sinuses and foetal capillaries; labelled dissociation curves for O2 and CO2 detailing the differences between maternal and foetal Hb; a placental gas exchange diagram, showing foetal and maternal arterial and venous gas tensions and content values."
