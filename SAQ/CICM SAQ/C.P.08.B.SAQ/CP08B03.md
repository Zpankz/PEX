title: "Compare and contrast the bodyâ€™s bicarbonate, phosphate and protein buffer systems."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 03
passRate: 60
EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good pass candidates were expected to include a definition of a buffer; mention the buffering capabilities of the differing buffering systems (bicarbonate, phosphate and protein buffers) in relation to the pKa; the area in the body where they are most effective and whether it was an open or closed system."
EC_extraCredit:
- "For a good answer it was expected that candidates also mention that, except for the red blood cells, the slowness with which H+ and HCO3- move through the cell membranes often delays for several hours the maximum ability of the intracellular proteins to buffer extracellular acid-base abnormalities."
- "In addition to the high concentration of proteins in the cells, another factor that contributes to their buffering power is the fact that the pKas of many of these protein systems are fairly close to 7.4."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The protein buffer system was the least well conveyed by candidates, despite approximately 60 to 70 per cent of the total chemical buffering of the body fluids being inside the cells, and most of this from the intracellular proteins."
