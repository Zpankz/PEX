- "A good answer for this question required the description of the pathway of bilirubin production beginning with the breakdown of haemoglobin breakdown, then haem to biliverdin by biliverdin reductase, biliverdin to bilirubin, bilirubin transported to liver bound to plasma proteins, bilirubin monoglucuronide and diglucuronide by conjugation, secreted into bile. Secretion into bile is dependent on active transport and is the first to be impaired in inflammation of the liver. Bilirubis metabolized to stercobilinogen which is absorbed and excreted in urine as urobilinogen. The remaining part to this question flowed on from this point, ie Intrahepatic disease – increased conjugated bilirubin, urobilinogen and urine bilirubin, Posthepatic disease – increased conjugated bilirubin, no urobilinogen, increased urine bilirubin"
