title: "Compare and contrast the pharmacology of midazolam and dexmedetomidine when used for sedation."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 14
passRate: 20
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A good answer was expected to include the following points. Under mechanism of action, mention that both drugs produce sedation by hyperpolarizing CNS nerve membranes and act on different receptors (Midazolam binds the benzodiazepine receptor and dexmedetomidine being selective for the a2 receptor). Also mention of other effects for each drug, eg anxiolytic, anticonvulsunt, analgesia, etc. A similar approach would be required for other key areas such as metabolism and excretion,(including alterations with age, organ failure, disease, etc), drug interactions, pharmacodynamics, particularly in relation to important physiological effects (eg CNS and CVS effects)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A brief summary of the similarities and differences which influence the clinical use of these agents gained more marks and showed the candidate had applied knowledge of these drugs."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The common omissions were lack of explanation of mechanism of action and failure to mention pharmacodynamic effects, drug interactions and specific advantages for each agent."
