EC_expectedDomains:
- "A good answer required the following points â€“ Classification and examples - gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes or pneumoniae or agalactiae), gram-negative cocci (Neisseria meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae), gram-positive bacilli (Bacillus anthracis, Listeria, corynebacteria, Clostridium difficile, etc), gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia Coli or E. Coli, Proteus, Yersinia, Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella). Mechanisms of resistance include: a) Enzyme inactivation, beta-lactamase or Extended Spectrum Beta-lactamase b) Enzyme addition: enzyme produced by bacteria that add a chemical group to the antibiotic to inhibit its activity, aminoglycoside resistance by Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas. c) Impermeability, anaerobes have no oxygen-dependent transport mechanism which stops the penetration of aminoglycosides into the bacteria. d) Efflux mechanisms by acquisition of an inner member protein which actively pumps antibiotics out of the cell, E.Coli becomes resistance to tetracycline by this mechanism. e) Alternative pathway to circumvent the metabolic block impose by antibiotic, Some Staphylococcus aureus are resistant to methicillin by developing or acquiring the gene mecA which produces an alternative penicillin binding protein and hence they are not inhibited by methicillin. f) Alteration of the target site, rifampicin resistance by point mutations, insertions, or deletions in RNA polymerase gene."
