title: "Outline the pharmacology of amiodarone."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 05
passRate: 40
EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good pass candidates were expected to actions of amiodarone (eg blocks inactivated Na channels, decreases Ca current, noncompetitive adrenergic blocking effect, blocks myocardial K channels which contributes to slowing of conduction and prolongation of refractory period in AV node, prolongs refractory period in all cardiac tissues, prolongs cardiac action potential duration) and it’s pharmacokinetics (eg bioavailability, large volume of distribution, high protein binding, complex metabolism and long elimination half life – 29 days)"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Successful candidates applied, a systematic approach/format to answer questions that refer to outlining pharmacology of select drugs."
- "A number of useful mnemonics are suggested in the recommended texts for use when answering such a question."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "All candidates correctly stated what amiodarone is used for but most were not structured methodically and thus suffered from significant omission."
