- "A good answer was expected to contain the following points: Angiotensinogen is cleaved by kidney-derived renin to form the decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang I); ACE converts Ang I to Ang II; Ang II is a potent arterial vasoconstrictor and an important mediator of Na+ and water retention through its effects on glomerular filtration pressure and aldosterone secretion; Ang II potentiates neural catecholamine release, is a secretagogue for catecholamine release from the adrenal medulla, promotes vascular hyperplasia and pathologic myocardial hypertrophy. ACE inhibitors suppress Ang II and aldosterone production, decrease sympathetic nervous system activity, and potentiate the effects of diuretics in heart failure. ACE is identical to kininase II, which degrades bradykinin and other kinins that stimulate production of NO, cyclic GMP, and vasoactive eicosanoids; these vasodilator substances seem to oppose the effects of Ang II on the growth of vascular smooth muscle and cardiac fibroblasts and on production of extracellular matrix. Thus, the increased levels of bradykinin that result from ACE inhibition may play a role in the hemodynamic and anti-remodeling effects of ACE inhibitors. An alternative means of attenuating the haemodynamic and vascular impact of the renin-angiotensin system is through inhibition of angiotensin receptors. Most of the known clinical actions of angiotensin II are mediated through the AT1 angiotensin receptor. AT1 receptor antagonists may provide more potent reduction of the effects of angiotensin II than do ACE inhibitors."
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Thus this question required integration of knowledge of the renin-angiotensin system and how pharmacological agents affect it in the treatment of cardiac failure."
- "Candidates were expected to describe the pathway and the influence of these drug groups on cardiac failure and to recognise underlying basic physiological principles such as the interaction between AT1 and AT2 receptors along with awareness of production of Ang II by ACE-independent enzymes."
