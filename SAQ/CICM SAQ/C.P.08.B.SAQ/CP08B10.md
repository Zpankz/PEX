title: "Outline the pharmacological properties of an ideal agent for sedating patients undergoing mechanical ventilation in intensive care (50% of marks). Describe how propofol compares to the ‘ideal’ agent (50% of marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 80
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A good answer included the following logical subheadings: Desirable pharmacology – long shelf life, stable when drawn up and on exposure to light, cheap, mixes well with other agents in the central line lumen. Bacteriostatic, Desirable pharmacokinetics – Low volume of distribution, rapid clearance (context-sensitive half-life), clearance not affected by either renal or hepatic dysfunction. Little inter-individual variation in pharmacokinetics. (Availability of an antagonist), Desirable pharmacodynamics – Affects only CNS. Reliable dose – effect curve with little inter-individual variation in effect. Anxiolysis. (Analgesic properties). No effect on cardiovascular performance. Does not depress respiratory drive, Minimal side effects – No incidences of allergy / anaphylaxis. No idiosyncratic reactions. No tachyphylaxis."
- "As indicated, 50% of the marks were allocated to mentioning how well propofol reflects these properties."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Mention of ‘propofol infusion syndrome’ characterised by cardiac failure which can occur when propofol is used at >4mg/Kg/Hr for more than 24 hours also attracted marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates can benefit by having a system by which they approach topics that involve a broad and general topic such as that of the pharmacology of a particular drug or ideal agent."
