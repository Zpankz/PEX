title: "Define basal metabolic rate and describe factors that influence it (70% of marks). How could you measure metabolic rate? (30% of marks)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 04
passRate: 60
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A good answer was expected to outline conditions under which basal metabolic rate is measured (no food for 12 hours, after a night of restful sleep, person is at rest in reclining position for 30 minutes, all psychic or physical factors that cause excitement eliminated, at a controlled comfortable temperature), and the mention of and an explanation of the methods by which metabolic rate is measured (eg direct and indirect calorimetry)."
- "Candidates were expected to briefly mention and explain how factors affecting metabolic rate (eg exercise, specific dynamic action of protein after a meal is ingested,, age, thyroid hormone, sympathetic stimulation, fever, gender, hormonal, climate, sleep, chronic malnutrition, trauma, inflammatory response, etc)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Any validated technique of determining the BMR was rewarded with marks, with oxygen consumption methods being the easiest to explain."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates often confused basal with metabolism during activity."
- "No candidate mentioned any ‘normal’ value for the BMR."
