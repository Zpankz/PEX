title: "Describe the formation, circulation and functions of cerebrospinal fluid."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 06
passRate: 80
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To achieve a pass in this question, candidates needed to state where and how CSF was formed, where it flows to after formation followed by a list of its functions."
- "Thus candidates were expected to mention that there is ~ 150 ml of CSF in the adult, half within the cranium; about 60-70% of the CSF is formed by the choroid plexuses, the remaining 30-40% by the cerebral vessels lining the ventricular walls; in humans the CSF turns-over ~ 4 times/day; composition is essentially brain ECF; brain ECF normally occupies ~ 15% of brain volume; CSF flows out through the foramina of Magendie and Luschka and is absorbed through the arachnoid villi into the cerebral venous sinuses; absorption, being largely by bulk flow, is proportional to ventricular pressure [at normal pressure ~ 7.0-18.0 cmH2O (mean ~ 11), filtration = absorption, when pressure falls below ~ 7 cmH2O absorption ceases] and CSF Functions [buoyancy, constant metabolic environment, buffers CSF against rapid plasma changes in K+, Ca++, Mg++, transport of chemical messengers, sink for waste disposal]."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional credit was given for knowledge of rates of production and basic CSF composition."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A number of candidates embarked on long discussions of how CSF pH affects physiology to the exclusion of what was asked for in the question."
- "Many answers did not adequately cover the three components asked for in the question."
- "The fact that CSF production is constant whilst its absorption is pressure dependant was often overlooked."
