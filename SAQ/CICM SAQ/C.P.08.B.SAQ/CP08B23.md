title: "Describe the factors which contribute to inter-individual variability in drug response seen with an induction dose of an intravenous anaesthetic drug."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 23
passRate: 40
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question required the candidate to provide some detail why a given dose of intravenous anaesthetic administered for the purpose of induction may result in a variable response between individuals."
- "A logical division into pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors pertaining to the drug and how these are impacted by patient physiology, citing appropriate examples, was expected."
- "Extremes of age, pregnancy, low and high cardiac output states, sympathetic tone, body habitus and factors impacting on drug redistribution and elimination should have been addressed."
- "Discussion of the “bolus effect” versus slow infusion of an induction drug, relative to these factors should have been included."
- "Mention of drug interactions, idiosyncratic reactions and relevant pathophysiology impairing organ function reserve was appropriate."
- "The consequences of variability in drug response in terms of over- / underdosing, haemodynamic compromise, respiratory depression, delayed recovery and allergic reactions needed emphasis to demonstrate understanding of the significance of predisposing factors."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The lack of a structured approach to this question was invariably unsuccessful."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were awarded for relevant discussion of pharmacogenetics."
