entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2008
sitting: B
question: 17
passRate: 40
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A good answer required the following points Definition of morbid obesity (>200% ideal body weight or body mass index > 35), Upper airway effects: fat infiltration of pharyngeal soft tissues difficult airway, prone to airway obstruction eg OSA, O2 consumption and CO2 production: due to total body fat, requires cardiac output and alveolar ventilation, FRC mainly via ERV: due to mass loading and splinting of diaphragm, upright obese, closing capacity > FRC small airway closure, V/Q mismatch, venous admixture and arterial hypoxaemia, O2 stores, total respiratory system compliance: chest wall compliance , subcutaneous and intra abdominal fat excess, lung compliance, airways resistance, work of breathing, resp muscle efficiency, Altered ventilatory control: Obstructive sleep apnoea, Obesity hypoventilation syndrome"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Major area of weakness of candidates was a lack of depth and breadth in knowledge of this topic and in applying basic physiology."
