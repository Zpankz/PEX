EC_expectedDomains:
- "Most candidates quite correctly approached this from the perspective of “West’s zones of the lung."
- "A clear description of the relationship between pulmonary arterial, venous and alveolar pressures producing the classical 3 zones was expected, along with situations which may alter the normal balance between the 3 zones, e.g. changing posture or airway pressure."
- "Whilst most candidates described recruitment and distension with respect to changing pulmonary arterial pressure, candidates were also expected to correctly state that an increase in pulmonary artery pressure is only observed when these processes are exhausted, or in the setting of pulmonary vascular disease, then describing the subsequent effects of pulmonary hypertension on the heart and circulation."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Additional points were awarded for candidates describing ‘zone 4’ or alternate theories of V/Q distribution."
- "Use of appropriate graphs to illustrate some of the above points would have been desirable."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The vascular tree is distensible, that is, a change in pressure will produce a corresponding increase in dimension of the blood vessels: Vascular distensibility = increase in volume Increase in pressure x original volume Increased pressure delivered to the arterioles causes dilation and decreases resistance to flow, increasing flow by as much as twice what would be expected due to pressure alone The veins are 6 to 10 x as distensible as arteries owing to the structural differences in their respective walls. A notable exception is the pulmonary circulation where arteries are approximately ½ as distensible as veins; this buffers pressure changes transmitted to the alveolar capillaries and also permits the arteries to adopt a reservoir function."
- "Pulmonary vascular resistance is also a function of lung volume. At extremes pulmonary capillaries are linearly stretched and collapse as may occur with hyperinflation. At very low lung volumes, extra-alveolar blood vessels become compressed and flow reduces (Zone 4)."
