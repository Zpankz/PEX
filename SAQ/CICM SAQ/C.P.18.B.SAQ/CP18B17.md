EC_expectedDomains:
- "Important facts included what ketone bodies are, where they were synthesised, where they were taken up and used as fuel, under what circumstances they are used and the integral role of insulin."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Whilst most candidates understood that ketones provided an alternative source of substrate for energy production, many lacked a basic understanding of their synthesis and metabolism. Many candidates accurately reproduced the glycolytic and/or the TCA cycle, but this was not being examined, and did not score additional marks. Many candidates incorrectly stated that ketone production was the result of anaerobic metabolism."
