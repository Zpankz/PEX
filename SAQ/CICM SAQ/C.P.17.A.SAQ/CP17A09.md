EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates incorrectly stated that the PT assessed the intrinsic system and that the APTT assessed the extrinsic system. This led to subsequent errors in relating a coagulation test to the appropriate coagulation factors that it assessed. Some candidates produced elaborate diagrams of the coagulation cascade in isolation without relating it to the question."
