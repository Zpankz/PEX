title: "Define mixed venous PO2 (20% of marks). Outline the factors that affect this value (80% of marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2017
sitting: A
question: 19
passRate: 37
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question was in two parts – the first part was worth 20% and candidates were expected to provide a definition of mixed venous blood as well as the partial pressure of oxygen in mixed venous blood (including normal range)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good answers also provided the varying PO 2 from different tissue beds that make up mixed venous blood, where the ‘mixing’ occurs (the right ventricle) and where it is sampled (pulmonary artery)."
- "For the second part of the question, worth 80% of the marks, good answers included the relationship between mixed venous PO2 and mixed venous O2 content (including the shape and position of the HbO2 dissociation curve); the variables encompassed in the modified Fick equation; arterial oxygen content and its determinants; oxygen consumption (VO 2); and cardiac output (CO). Including an outline of how each affects the value of mixed venous PO 2."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A number of candidates wrote about mixed venous oxygen saturation. Other common errors were: missing a number of key factors that affect PO 2; and using an incorrect form and/or content of the modified Fick equation."
