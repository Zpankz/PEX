EC_errorsCommon:
- "Almost all candidates interpreted \"metabolic fate\" to mean absorption, digestion and transport of fat. Hence a lot of time was spent on this and little on the fate of fat once it enters the blood stream. The processes of neither beta oxidation, nor lipogenesis were not well understood."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Ketone body production was better understood."
