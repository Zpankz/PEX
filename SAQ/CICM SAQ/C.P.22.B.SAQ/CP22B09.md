EC_expectedDomains:
- "examples of antibiotics from different categories of mechanism of action"
- "describe specific side effects relevant or unique to that antibiotic"
EC_extraCredit:
- "the use of a tabular format as an answer template resulted in answers scoring marks in most time efficient manner"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Mechanisms of action that were generic in terms of site of action attracted fewer marks."
- "Some examples of antibiotics that candidates provided were not anti-staphylococcal antibiotics (eg; Benzyl Penicillin, Clavulanic acid)."
- "many papers showed a lack of detail regarding the precise mechanism of action of penicillins particularly around inhibition of transpeptidases whilst the use of non-specific side effects such as nausea vomiting and diarrhoea did not attract marks."
