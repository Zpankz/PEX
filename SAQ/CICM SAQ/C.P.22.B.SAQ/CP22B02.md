EC_expectedDomains:
- "main constituents of the two products"
- "production of the two products"
- "specific list of indications"
- "ABO matching with FFP but not prothrombin concentrates"
- "larger fluid load of FFP in comparison to prothrombin concentrates"
EC_extraCredit:
- "FFP may still contain some cells, or that prothrombin concentrates contain heparin"
- "components and concentration/amounts would need to be accurately described"
- "Rhesus matching is not required"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A more comprehensive and specific list of indications than rather than \"bleeding\" or \"coagulopathy\" was expected."
- "rigidly adhering to it, for instance, noting FFP's \"poor oral bioavailability\" - did not garner marks"
- "heparin is not reversed by FFP and FFP may in fact increase heparin's effect"
- "FFP does not cause dilutional coagulopathy, it is the treatment for dilutional coagulopathy"
