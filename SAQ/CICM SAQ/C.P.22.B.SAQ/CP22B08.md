college: CICM
year: 2022
sitting: B
question: 08
passRate: 35
EC_expectedDomains:
- "classification of calcium channel blockers"
- "A basic understanding of the common features of verapamil (indeed most of these are common to the calcium channel blockers as a group) in clinical practice and toxicology"
EC_extraCredit:
- "relevant examples with their classification"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Marks allocated to dosing and presentation were not gained for writing that it is available as tablets or as a clear colourless solution, unless relevant information was given."
- "Many candidates listed neuropsychiatric effects of verapamil, which are not a feature normally associated with calcium channel blockers."
- "Many also listed QT prolongation among its effects, which is not listed in the standard texts and is the opposite to the true effect."
- "in some papers there appeared to be a contradiction between the effect of Verapamil on the cardiac action potential and the detail provided about the drugs clinical effects, these answers demonstrated a lack of solidity in the understanding of the underlying physiology."
