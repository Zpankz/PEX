title: "Describe the anatomical (20% marks) and physiological (80% marks) features of the pulmonary circulation."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2022
sitting: B
question: 15
passRate: 23
EC_expectedDomains:
- "anatomical pattern of right ventricle to arteries to smaller arteries to arterioles to capillaries to venules to veins to the left atrium"
- "relevant aspects of anatomy including main pulmonary artery ~5cm in length divides into L and R pulmonary arteries. Arteries are relatively thin walled with little smooth muscle, capillaries form an extensive sheet of blood flow over the alveolar wall, and the pulmonary circulation drains into four pulmonary veins that empty into the left atrium"
- "~500 ml of blood in the pulmonary circulation with ~10% in the capillaries and half the remainder in each of arteries and veins. The system has a high capacitance and is very distensible. The volume can halve or double to adjust for posture, respiratory effort and changes to the systemic circulation"
- "Values for normal pulmonary artery pressure were expected and an explanation that this is just adequate to reach the apices of the lung and that if the pulmonary pressure was higher there would be a risk of compromised perfusion and flow"
- "regional distribution and regulation is relatively passive compared to the systemic circulation and thus gravity and posture have significant effects"
- "the important role of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction to optimise VQ matching"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Comparisons with the systemic pressures or detail such as capillary values gained extra credit."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates gave the units incorrectly."
- "few seemed aware of the importance of low pulmonary pressure relative to the effect of gravity, such that the pulmonary arterial pressure was just adequate to reach the apex of the lung."
- "Many candidates wrote in generalities about the physiology of circulatory systems without discussing special features of the pulmonary circulation."
- "The detail supplied was often less than the expected level."
