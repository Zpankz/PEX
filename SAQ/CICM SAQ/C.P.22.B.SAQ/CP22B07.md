sitting: B
question: 07
passRate: 35
EC_expectedDomains:
- "the concept of achieving maximum urinary concentrating ability"
- "description of the usual concentrating processes and the changes that would occur in circumstances where maximally concentrated urine would be made"
- "the creation of a medullary concentration gradient to allow water reabsorption independent of solute reabsorption"
- "the contribution of the loop of Henle, the vasa recta, and urea cycling in the creation and maintenance of this gradient, along with the impact of ADH"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Answers that focused solely on the counter-current exchange and multiplier process were insufficient on their own to achieve a passing mark."
- "a significant proportion of candidates excluded the role of urea in their answers."
