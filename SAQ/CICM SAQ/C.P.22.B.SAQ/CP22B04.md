college: CICM
year: 2022
sitting: B
question: 04
passRate: 22
EC_expectedDomains:
- "a list of factors which increase respiratory rate"
- "physiological reasoning behind each mechanism"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Providing a list of factors was not sufficient for a pass."
- "Vague, imprecise answers attracted fewer marks."
- "Many candidates did not demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms."
- "Most answers failed to include all the stimulants of respiratory rate, especially the non-chemical controls."
- "Many answers were not structured or structured in a way that meant they missed many of the mechanisms or that they repeated the same information through the answer which used time but failed to gain additional marks."
