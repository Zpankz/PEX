title: "Draw a labelled diagram of both the aortic root and radial artery pressure waveforms in a young adult using the same axis (60% marks). Explain the factors that account for the differences between these two waveforms (40% marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2022
sitting: B
question: 10
passRate: 21
EC_expectedDomains:
- "accurately representing the different shapes, correct axis (pressure and timing) and labelling"
- "description of the differences"
EC_extraCredit:
- "The windkessel effect"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "there were often contradictions between what was drawn and described. For example, several answers correctly described a delay in the systolic peak seen in the radial artery, but this was not illustrated in the diagram."
- "Interruptions to the arterial traces from the anacrotic and diacrotic notches, the origins of the diacrotic hump, and insuria were often incorrect and poorly explained."
- "a lack of integration of the waveform and translation of that knowledge into a description of the cardiac cycle was often poorly done."
