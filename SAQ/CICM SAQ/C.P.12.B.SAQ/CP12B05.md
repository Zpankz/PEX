EC_expectedDomains:
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good answers were structured using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics headings."
- "They included some mention of changes in absorption, volume of distribution (an increase in Vd in liver failure), altered protein binding, altered metabolism and thus change in clearance, and changes in excretion (decreased biliary excretion of drugs)."
- "In respect to pharmacodynamics candidates could have mentioned increased sensitivity and prolonged action of sedative drugs, oral anticoagulants, etc."
- "Good candidates also differentiated for acute (often hepatocellular dysfunction) and chronic liver failure (cirrhosis and changes in liver blood flow)."
- "Primary examination questions may often require candidates to integrate knowledge from across different sections of the syllabus or apply basic physiological or pharmacological principles."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common problems were not using a logical structure to answer the question and stating an effect but not describing how this affected pharmacology."
- "For example stating decreased albumin production but then not stating the consequence of this on drug distribution."
