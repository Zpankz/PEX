EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question was generally well answered."
- "The constituents of plasma include water, electrolytes, glucose, liver enzymes, urea, creatinine, uric acid, dissolved gases and proteins."
- "Plasma does not contain any cells."
- "The proteins in plasma are albumin, globulins and fibrinogen."
- "The globulins include alpha 1 and 2 and beta globulins and gamma globulins."
- "Examples of α1- Globulins are: α1-fetoprotein, α1-protease inhibitor and prothrombin."
- "Examples of α2-Globulins include: ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, α2-macroglobulin and thyroxin-binding globulin."
- "Examples of β-Globulins are: C-reactive protein, β2-microglobulin and transferrin."
- "Examples of δ-Globulins are the immunoglobulins , IgG, IgA, IgM, etc."
- "There are many more other globulins including the coagulation factors, the complement system and lipoproteins."
- "The functions of plasma proteins include oncotic pressure, transport/carrier function, role in acid base balance (buffering, CO2 transport) and proteolytic systems such as complement, kinins, coagulation and fibrinolysis."
- "More functions include the immune response, enzyme activity eg pseudocholinesterase, metabolism i.e. plasma proteins can be broken down and contribute amino acids to the amino acid pool and a role in thermoregulation."
- "The question asked to “list” the constituents, so the level of detail required to score marks reflected this and should have been achievable in the allocated timeframe."
EC_extraCredit:
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many answers were deficient in details on the plasma proteins and their functions."
