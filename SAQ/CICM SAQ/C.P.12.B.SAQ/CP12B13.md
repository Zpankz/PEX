EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question could be approached by describing the effects of obesity on drug distribution, binding and elimination."
- "With obesity, fat body mass increases relative to the increase in lean body mass leading to an increased volume of distribution particularly for highly lipid soluble drugs, e.g. midazolam."
- "However, the dosing of non-lipid soluble drugs, e.g. non-depolarising muscle relaxants, should be based on ideal body weight."
- "An increase in blood volume and cardiac output associated with obesity may require an increased loading dose to achieve a therapeutic effect, e.g. thiopentone."
- "Plasma protein binding of drugs may be decreased due to an increased binding of lipids to plasma proteins, resulting in an increased free fraction of drug."
- "A reduction in plasma protein concentration due to an increase in acute phase proteins may also result in decreased plasma protein drug binding and increased free fraction of drug."
- "Pseudocholinesterase levels are increased in obesity and therefore the dose of suxamethonium should be based on total body weight."
- "Plasma and tissue esterase levels are increased resulting in the increased clearance of drugs by these enzymes e.g. remifentanil."
- "Hepatic clearance is usually normal but may be impaired in liver disease caused by obesity."
- "Renal clearance is usually increased due to increased body weight, increased renal blood flow and increased glomerular filtration rate."
- "Renal clearance may be impaired in renal disease caused by obesity related diseases, e.g. diabetes."
- "Insulin doses may be increased due to peripheral insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes caused by obesity."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates that took this approach generally did better than those with a less structured approach."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most answers were deficient in examples of drugs to illustrate the effects of obesity on drug pharmacology."
