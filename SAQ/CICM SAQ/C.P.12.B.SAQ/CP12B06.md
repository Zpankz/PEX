EC_expectedDomains:
- "The answer required a description of surfactant composition (phospholipids 85%, neutral lipids 5%, and proteins 10%)."
- "Phospholipid dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine is the main surface active component."
- "It was expected candidates would provide a description of the arrangement of the phospholipids with the hydrophilic head in the aqueous phase and the hydrophobic tail in the airspace of the alveolus."
- "The effects of surfactant required an explanation of surface tension and how this affects alveoli."
- "One good way to explain this was describing how La Place’s law would affect alveoli with, and without, surfactant."
- "As the alveoli decrease in size, the surfactant molecules are pushed together and exert a greater surface tension lowering effect. Surfactant is also important in the lung elastic recoil and hysteresis and for alveolar stability preventing collapse and thereby improving lung compliance and decreasing work of breathing."
- "Surfactant also helps oppose the starling forces in the lung and keep fluid from being drawn into the alveoli."
EC_extraCredit:
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates often misunderstood La Place’s law and did not explain how surfactant decreases surface tension."
