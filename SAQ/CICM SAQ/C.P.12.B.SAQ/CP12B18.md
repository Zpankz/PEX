EC_expectedDomains:
- "Inotropes are drugs that increase the force and velocity of myocardial contraction resulting in increased contractility and stroke volume and hence cardiac output."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good answers were those that adopted a systematic approach, such as providing a coherent list of ideal properties that included pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics characteristics, and then contrasted adrenaline against that list."
- "The area less well covered was that of those aspects of adrenaline that made it less than an ideal inotrope, e.g. it increases myocardial oxygen consumption, causes tachyarrhythmias, tolerance may develop, hyperglycaemia, lactic acid production, etc."
