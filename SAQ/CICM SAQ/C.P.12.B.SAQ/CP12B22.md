EC_expectedDomains:
- "The amide group of local anaesthetics consist of lignocaine, prilocaine, ropivacaine and bupivacaine."
- "The systemic toxicity primarily relates to toxic plasma levels and the factors that influence this."
- "The main factors expected can be categorized under drug factors (including kinetics), patient factors, site of injection and external factors."
- "For example, absorption is affected by drug pKA, (the closer to physiological pH the more rapid the absorption), use of vasoconstrictors and the drugs own vasoactive properties, site of injection (intercostal>epidural>brachial plexus>subcutaneous infiltration)."
- "Distribution is dependent on physicochemical properties of the amide."
- "The rate of metabolism, mechanism of action (bupivacaine, in comparison to lignocaine has stronger binding to inactivated resting sodium channels and a slower rate of dissociation) and external factors (e.g. systemic acidosis) are other factors that should have been mentioned, and expanded upon with relevant detail."
EC_extraCredit:
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates omitted important details such as pKA, lipid solubility and addition of vasoconstrictors."
