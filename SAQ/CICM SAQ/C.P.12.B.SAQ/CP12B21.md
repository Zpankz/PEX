EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to present a mechanistic description the neuro-cellular events following a rise in PaCO2 such as changes in H+ in CSF, stimulation of central and peripheral chemoreceptors and neural pathways that lead to stimulation of respiratory centre."
- "A systematic approach to the question with in-depth details of direction and magnitude of physiologic changes were required."
- "Most candidates presented graphs of cerebral blood flow and tidal volume changes with increasing PaCO2."
EC_extraCredit:
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common omissions included other important points, such as the cardiovascular and respiratory effects of rising CO2 and the rightward shift of oxygen haemoglobin curve."
