EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answer the following areas should have been addressed. Diagnostic tests may be correct or incorrect."
- "The accuracy of a test is assessed by its sensitivity (true positive rate) and its specificity (true negative rate)."
- "The ROC provides a graphical representation of the trade-off between sensitivity on the y axis and specificity or 1-specificity (false positive rate) on the x axis."
- "Any increase in sensitivity will be accompanied by a decrease in specificity."
- "It accounts for an arbitrary cut off level made for a test or comparing two or more diagnostic tests."
- "A gradient of 1 (area under the curve of 0.5) suggests that the test has no predictive ability."
- "A steeper gradient has increased area under the curve (ideally > 0.75) and improved predictive ability."
- "The best point on the curve is dependent on the consequences of a false positive compared with a false negative of the test and is usually the L elbow of the curve."
- "The ROC is not affected by changes in prevalence as sensitivity and specificity are not dependant on prevalence."
- "An illustration of the ROC, with correctly labelled axis and features was essential to answer this question."
- "This area is well covered in the recommended text Statistical Methods for Anaesthesia and Intensive Care by P Myles and T Gin pages 98 to 99."
