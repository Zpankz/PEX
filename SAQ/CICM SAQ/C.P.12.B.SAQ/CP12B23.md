EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were expected to present the cellular mechanisms underlying the control of skeletal muscle blood flow."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Many candidates correctly identified a role for sympathetic nervous system, metabolic (e.g. vasodilator metabolites such as CO2, H+, K+, lactate and adenosine), vasoactive substances released by endothelium (nitric oxide, prostacyclin, endothelin 1, etc.) and autoregulatory control but failed to present any details of direction and magnitude of control."
- "Better answers also mentioned humeral (e.g. catecholamines, vasopressin, ANP, angiotensin II, histamine, serotonin, etc.) or myogenic control (i.e. when the pressure within a smooth muscle blood vessel is suddenly increased, the vascular smooth muscle is stretched."
