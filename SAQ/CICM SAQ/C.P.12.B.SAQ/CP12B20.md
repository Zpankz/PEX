EC_expectedDomains:
- "Enantiomers refer to isomeric molecules with centres of asymmetry in 3 dimensions that are mirror images of each other but not superimposable."
- "Enantiomers may be distinguished by the direction in which polarised light is rotated."
- "Interactions involving weak drug-receptor bonds feature a dependence upon recognition of shape, i.e. stereochemical structure is often important."
- "Frequently one enantiomer may bind to a given receptor more avidly than the other, thus pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and toxicity may vary between enantiomers."
- "Many drugs are supplied as racemic mixtures, the components of which have different activity."
- "Clinically relevant examples that candidates could have mentioned, included bupivacaine, ropivacaine, ketamine and carvedilol."
