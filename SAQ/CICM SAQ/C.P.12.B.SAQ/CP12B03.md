EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answer candidates were expected to provide information on essential facts such as, normal inspired air has low water content, normal humidification provides for saturated water vapour 47mmHg at sea level at the alveolus, which corresponds to an absolute humidity of 44 g/m3 (or 100% relative humidity) at 37.C."
- "Furthermore, candidates were expected to outline the basics of the anatomical features of the respiratory tract that promotes humidification e.g. lining of nose and hypopharynx dissolving warm water vapour into the dry inhaled air, the fact that the turbinates act to increase surface area and that full saturation is achieved by the time air reaches the upper trachea."
- "For the second part of the question candidates were expected to mention, and briefly describe, the mechanisms of achieving humidification, e.g. bubble systems, heat-moister exchange filters, heated water, ultrasonic, etc. mechanisms."
