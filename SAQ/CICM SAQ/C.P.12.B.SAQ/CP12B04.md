EC_expectedDomains:
- "Contractility represents the performance of the heart at a given preload and afterload."
- "It is the change in peak isometric force (isovolumic pressure) at a given initial fibre length (end diastolic volume)."
- "All indices of myocardial contractility are dependent on preload or afterload to a varying degree."
- "The dP/dT is the maximum rate of change in left ventricular pressure during isovolumetric contraction, after mitral valve closes and before the aortic valve opens."
- "It is preload dependant and afterload independent."
- "Candidates were then expected to at least explain that, as preload is increased a new pressure volume loop is generated."
- "Each new PV loop has a new end systolic point that is at a slightly higher pressure and volume than the previous end systolic point."
- "The line connecting the end-systolic points is called the linear ESPVR."
- "The slope of the ESPVR or Emax is used as an index of myocardial contractility."
- "Ejection fraction is the percentage of the ventricular end diastolic volume (EDV) which is ejected with each stroke volume (SV)."
- "Ejection fraction = stroke volume/end diastolic volume X 100 (Normal range 55 to 70%)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "A diagram of a pressure volume loop is very helpful when describing the ESPV."
- "Only a minority of candidates achieved the depth of knowledge required for a Level 1 topic."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Absence of a diagram (correctly labelled and scaled) was a weakness in many answers."
