EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main respiratory consequences of an acute C6 transection include the effects on the inspiratory muscles, the expiratory muscles, lung volumes, effects of changes in posture and effects on gas exchange."
- "Sparing of the phrenic nerve, the main muscle of inspiration (C3 5), but paralysis of the external intercostal muscles innervated by thoracic nerve roots results in paradoxical inward movement of the chest wall on inspiration."
- "Paralysis of all the expiratory muscles including the internal intercostal muscles innervated by thoracic nerve roots and the abdominal wall muscles, which are innervated by lower thoric and lumbar nerves."
- "While expiration is normally passive these muscles are required for manoeuvres involving forced exhalation like coughing."
- "Forced expiratory lung volumes (FEV1 and FVC) are reduced."
- "Work of breathing is increased."
- "Static lung volumes reveal a restrictive lung defect with most lung volumes decreased but in particular expiratory reserve volume (ERV) is significantly reduced."
- "The reduction in FRC leads to airway closure, atelectasis and pathologic low V/Q and shunt and hence hypoxemia."
- "The second part of the question concerning the cardiovascular consequences of C6 transection was better answered."
- "Areas that required mention in this section included the early massive sympathetic outflow and hypertension via the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla."
- "Neurogenic shock is also seen due to interruption of the sympathetic outflow and impaired reflex vasoconstriction secondary to hypotension of any cause."
- "Finally the loss of sympathetic innervation of the heart (T1-T4) results in unopposed parasympathetic cardiac stimulation and bradycardia and bradyarrthymias."
EC_extraCredit:
- "These mechanisms can result in significant hypoxemia but were not described by many candidates."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates did not mention these muscles or their innervation in their answers."
