EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answer candidates were expected to mention that an agonist is a drug that elicits a maximal response on binding to a receptor."
- "A partial agonist has intrinsic affinity with only partial efficacy and hence is unable to elicit a maximal response."
- "A competitive drug acts at the same binding site of a receptor as an endogenous ligand (e.g. acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction) and its action therefore is surmountable with increasing concentrations of drug and how this concept relates to suxemethonium."
- "For the remainder of the question, Candidates were expected to mention the advantages and disadvantages of suxamethonium within Intensive Care practice."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good answers included a systematic approach and use of tables and/or well organised lists."
