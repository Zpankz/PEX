EC_expectedDomains:
- "The 5HT (5 Hydroxytryptamine or serotonin) receptor is a monoamine neurotransmitter synthesized from tryptophan, and is an important receptor in the body."
- "It is found in the CNS, gastrointestinal tract, platelets and mast cells."
- "There are 7 main receptor subtypes (GProtein coupled are 5HT1, 5HT2, 5HT4 and 5HT7 and ligand-gated ion channel 5HT3)."
- "Drugs may affect them by acting on serotonergic transmission (degradation inhibitors - MAOI e.g. selegiline, storage inhibitors- amphetamine, reuptake inhibitors - SSRI’s or tricyclic antidepressants), serotonin agonists (selective-5HT1B, 5HT1D e.g. triptans for migraine, non-selective, e.g. ergotamine), serotonin antagonists (ketanserin, clozapine, ondansetron)."
- "Ondansetron is a commonly used anti-emetic."
- "Candidates were expected to mention, that it is a selective antagonist at the 5HT3 receptor centrally and peripherally."
- "To outline “pharmacology” it was also expected that answers would mention that it comes in a variety of formulations and to outline its fundamental pharmacokinetic properties."
