EC_expectedDomains:
- "Knowledge of anatomy of the areas of the body where common procedures are performed in the intensive care unit is essential."
- "Defining the question by giving the boundaries and contents of the antecubital fossa along with a diagram illustrating the arrangement of the veins would have constituted a pass."
- "The course of the basilic vein and an explanation of why it is favoured over the cephalic vein (presence of the clavipectoral fascia which provides an acute angle for the catheter to negotiate along with a valve frequently located at the junction) was important applied anatomy relevant to PICC line insertion."

EC_errorsCommon:
