entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2023
sitting: A
question: 19
passRate: 20
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Factors prolonging neuromuscular blockade which would include a description of the reasoning behind the prolongation."
- "Vecuronium mechanism of action all the details were expected, superficial explanations did not score well. The following key words were expected to be included in the mechanism description; competitive binding/ Nicotinic ACH (N2)/alpha subunit/post synaptic."
- "In pharmacokinetics, details on hepatic metabolism to active metabolites, renal and biliary excretion along with accurate values of the volume of distribution, protein binding and half-life were expected to score full marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates missed the important factors and most did not include any explanation."
- "Some candidates confused the causes of delayed onset and prolonged action."
- "These facts were frequently lacking in candidate answers."
