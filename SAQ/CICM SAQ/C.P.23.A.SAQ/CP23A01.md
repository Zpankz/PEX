entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2023
sitting: A
question: 1
passRate: 21
EC_expectedDomains:
- "ABG findings including consideration of electrolyte abnormalities, A-a gradient, acid-base disturbance (including anion gap and strong ion difference) and whether compensation was appropriate"
- "Physicochemical basis of the Stewart approach"
- "Independent variables (strong ions, total weak acids, and pCO2) in detail"
- "Effect on the dependent variables and how they result in acid-base derangements"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The ABG provided depicted an incorrect base excess with an omission of (-) symbol."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates were marked accordingly depending on their response to this and all candidates were compensated equally for the confusion that this may have caused."
