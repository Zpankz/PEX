- "Direct and indirect calorimetry"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates provided reasonable definitions but lost marks for not describing the standard conditions under which it is defined."
- "Many were able to give a comprehensive list of factors that affected BMR however lacked the additional pertinent facts required in an outline question to achieve full marks."
- "There was a limited ability to discuss direct and indirect calorimetry clearly and some responses confused the two."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates are again referred to the glossary to understand the difference between a list and outline question."
