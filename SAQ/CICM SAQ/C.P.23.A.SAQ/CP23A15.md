title: "(a) Describe the adult coronary circulation (50% of Marks) and (b) its regulation (50% of Marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2023
sitting: A
question: 15
passRate: 66
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Arterial supply (epicardial, endocardial supplies)"
- "Venous supply (major and minor venous drainage)"
- "Phasic ventricular blood supply"
- "Relevance of the high oxygen extraction ratio"
- "Emphasis on metabolic autoregulation whilst including any other mechanisms of physiological regulation."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Less well described were the perforating branches, the capillary network and the venous drainage, these components were often incorrectly described or left out of the candidate answers."
- "The control of regulation was less well answered with generic statements not specifically identifying the local metabolic controls importance over any other mechanism."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Those candidates that used diagrams to explain this were rewarded when these diagrams were labelled and accurate with respect to their systolic and diastolic distinction."
- "Those answers that scored well coupled the metabolic control to the flow dependence highlighting the high oxygen extraction within the coronary circulation."
