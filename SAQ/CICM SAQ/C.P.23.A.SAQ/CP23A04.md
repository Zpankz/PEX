EC_errorsCommon:
- "No marks were given for simply listing the structural features of an alveolus without an explanation on how this facilitates function, nor for listing functional requirements of an alveolus without explaining whether or how they are met by its structure."
- "Simply listing equations with no discussion as to how these relate to the structure and function of the alveoli garnered no marks."
- "Common omissions included a description and the role of collagen and elastin fibres, capillary structure, the filtration function of the membrane, lymphatic drainage, recruitment and distensibility and metabolic functions."
