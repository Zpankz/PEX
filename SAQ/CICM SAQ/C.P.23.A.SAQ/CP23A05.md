EC_expectedDomains:
- "Net potassium flux is a function of filtration, reabsorption, secretion and excretion."
- "Division of the nephron into relevant sections and described how potassium was handled in each section."
- "Percentage reabsorption along each section, as well as the relevant active and passive pathways for reabsorption and/or secretion including the cells and channels/pumps involved."
- "Physiological factors regulating each of these mechanisms"
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This question related to the renal handling of potassium, the physiology of potassium in the rest of the body was not relevant."
