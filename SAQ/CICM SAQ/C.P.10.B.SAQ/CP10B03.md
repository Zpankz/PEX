EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates should also give consideration to the effects of critical illness (such as cardiac output, plasma binding and volume of distribution) affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs used in intensive care."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most candidates used a table to compare these two drugs, which was an ideal means to structure their answers to this question and a useful way to present the information required."
- "The use of a structured format for learning pharmacokinetic data about all drugs allows more useful information in a question such as this."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This particular section of the question was poorly answered."
