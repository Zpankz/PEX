title: "Describe the renal handling of bicarbonate and the changes in urine pH along the nephron. (80% of marks) How is this affected by hypoventilation? (20% of marks)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2010
sitting: B
question: 12
passRate: 27
lo:
- "[[D1 Renal Physiology]]"
- "[[2e]]"
- "[[2k]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answer candidates were expected to mention that bicarbonate is freely filtered, itâ€™s fate along the nephron and that it is not normally found in the urine."
- "Mechanisms by how it is reabsorbed and generated along the different segments of the nephron were expected to be described in some detail."
- "For a good answer candidates were expected to mention that Hypoventilation results in an increase in arterial PCO2 that readily diffuses into tubular cells resulting in increased intracellular H2CO3 and subsequently bicarbonate, that is reabsorbed, and H+ that is secreted."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This question sought knowledge of an important and basic area of physiology that applies to many circumstances encountered in daily intensive care practice."
- "The last part of this question relating to hypoventilation was poorly answered."
