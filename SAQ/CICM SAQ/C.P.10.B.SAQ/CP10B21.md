lo:
- "[[Q2d]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answer candidates were expected to mention liquids empty much faster (and in an exponential fashion) than solids (which have a linear pattern), rate of emptying depends on the pressure gradient generated by the antrum against pyloric resistance."
- "Antral pump activity is of most importance and that it is influenced by signals from both the stomach (eg distension) and the duodenum (volume, osmolarity, pH) and humoral factors (gastrin, cholecystikinin, secretin) and nervous stimulation (general parasympathetic nervous stimulation enhances gastric motility and sympathetic stimulation opposes it)."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This was another important, relevant and essential aspect of basic physiology, for which candidates tended to lack sufficient breath and depth of the required knowledge."
