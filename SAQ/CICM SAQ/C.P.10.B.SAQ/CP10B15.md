title: "Describe the physiological consequences of decreasing Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) by one litre in an adult."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2010
sitting: B
question: 15
passRate: 33
lo:
- "[[B1e]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This is core knowledge and it was expected candidates would describe physiological consequences accurately."
- "It was also expected that candidates mention that as FRC falls, alveolar closure occurs, lung compliance decreases and airway resistance increases work of breathing increases, pulmonary vascular resistance, and thus right ventricular afterload increases."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good answers included a definition of FRC and correct value."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "A number of candidates omitted this."
- "Many candidates described alveolar closure as causing increased dead space ventilation rather than altered V/Q."
