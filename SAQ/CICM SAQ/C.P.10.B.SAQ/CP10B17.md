entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2010

EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answer it was expected that at least the chemo and baroreceptor, Bainbridge (elicited by stretch receptors located in the right atrial wall and the cavoatrial junction), Cushing (result of cerebral medullary vasomotor centre ischemia), oculocardic (provoked by pressure applied to the globe of the eye or traction on the surrounding structures), Bezold-Jarisch (responds to noxious ventricular stimuli sensed by chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors within the LV wall) reflexes be mentioned and described."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This question required candidates to provide an answer that integrates their knowledge of various aspects of cardiovascular physiology."
- "Cardiac reflexes are fast-acting reflex loops between the heart and central nervous system that contribute to regulation of cardiac function and maintenance of physiologic homeostasis. This was often overlooked by many candidates."
