entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2010
sitting: B
question: 5

- "[[J2a]]"
- "[[J2d]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The best approach to answer this type of question was to use a table with each anti-platelet agent within a column and headings for the rows such as mechanisms of action, adverse effects, mode of elimination and duration of action."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most candidates did reasonably well by including aspirin, ADP receptor blockade and glycoprotein 2b/3a blockade in their answers."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common omissions included the irreversibility of the blockade of the platelet function by many of these agents, renal toxicity and bronchospasm as side effects of aspirin, bone marrow toxicity of ADP receptor blockers, and dipyridamole as an anti-platelet agent."
- "Some candidates classified clopidogrel as a glycoprotein 2b/3a blocker incorrectly and thought clopidogrel has a relative short duration of action on platelet function because of its half-life."
- "Clopidogrel as a prodrug requiring activation by cytochrome P450 and hence significant potential drug interactions were not mentioned by any candidates."
