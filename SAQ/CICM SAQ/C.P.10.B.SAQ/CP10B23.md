title: "Describe the ionic events associated with a ventricular cardiac action potential (80% of marks). Outline how the action potential relates with the mechanical events of the cardiac cycle (20 % marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2010
sitting: B
question: 23
passRate: 27
lo:
- "[[C1b]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To achieve a good pass in this question, candidates needed to outline the ionic events associated with Phase 0 to phase 4 of the ventricular action potential followed by a description of excitation â€“ contraction coupling."
- "The second part of the question was best answered using a ventricular pressure-volume loop and overlaying the phases of the ventricular action potential."
EC_extraCredit:
- "The use of illustrations helped answer this question."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Description of the ionic events associated with the action potential phases was generally well done, but this was as far as many answers went in answering this question."
- "Few candidates included a description of excitation-contraction coupling in there answer and few candidates considered an answer to the second part of the question."
