EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected that candidates define hypoxaemia and, in a structured manner, discuss the physiological causes of early postoperative hypoxaemia."
- "Candidates should always try and begin their answer with a definition of the term that is to be discussed."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers addressed different physiological causes of hypoxaemia, including areas of low V/Q; hypoventilation; increased oxygen consumption; loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and closing capacity exceeding functional residual capacity."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates invoked clinical disease related causes and not physiological. This did not score marks."
- "Similarly, factors leading to tissue hypoxia, such as anaemia or low 2,3-dpg were not given marks."
- "Candidates may have done so because they confused “hypoxaemia” with “hypoxia”."
