EC_expectedDomains:
- "Most candidates were able to detail how insulin allowed influx of glucose into insulin dependent cells, in combination with potassium."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good candidates were able to explain how the inability to produce insulin allowed hypovolaemia and electrolyte loss, with the ensuing tachycardia and hypotension."
- "Few candidates mentioned insulin’s action on hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), and that deficiency of insulin leads to increased activity of this enzyme."
- "The fact that when insulin is not produced, the liver cells carry out β-oxidation of the fatty acid (released peripherally by the action of HSL) releasing acetyl CoA which is coalesced into acetoacetic acid was mentioned by only a few."
- "However, the fact that ketone bodies in the form of acetoacetic acid, β-hydroxybutyric acid and acetone accumulate and cause a metabolic (anion gap) acidaemia, appeared to be well known."
- "Few, went on to describe that a compensatory respiratory alkalosis will be generated and detail how and why this occurred."
