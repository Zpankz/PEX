EC_expectedDomains:
- "For a good answer candidates were expected to list the following levels of evidence, eg Level I (evidence obtained from a systematic review of all (at least 2) relevant randomized controlled trials), Level II (evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial, Level III (evidence obtained from other well-designed experimental or analytical studies (not RCCTâ€™s), Level IV (evidence obtained from descriptive studies, reports of expert committees or from opinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience)."
- "Candidates were expected to define a meta-analysis (process of combining the results of different (randomised) trials to derive a pooled estimate of effect) and a systematic review (process of obtaining and evaluating all relevant trials, their statistical analyses and interpretation of results)."
- "In relation to strengths, a good answer required mentioning increased power of pooled data, analysis and conclusions based on inclusion of high quality trials (weighting of trial quality), overcomes the uncertainty associated with single-centre trials, robust methodology; combines similar patient groups, interventions and end-points to inform the analysis and established methods to find all relevant trials."
- "In relation to weaknesses, a good answer required mentioning publication bias, heterogeneity of included trials, pooled result may be biased toward the largest included trials, historical (outdated) data, and that positive results generally require confirmation by a large RCT"
