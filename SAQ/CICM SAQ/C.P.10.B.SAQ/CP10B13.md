EC_expectedDomains:
- "Most candidates identified the importance of the upper airway in humidification but did not describe details of this process and failed to discuss the events occurring during expiration."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This question was poorly answered by candidates."
- "Basic aspects, which were critical for a good answer, such as definitions were often inaccurate."
- "Terms such as ‘amount’ or ‘content’ were commonly used without provision of units, when mass or pressure was required."
- "The importance of temperature was often not mentioned."
