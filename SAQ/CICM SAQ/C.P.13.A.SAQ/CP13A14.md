title: "Describe the relevant anatomy for insertion of an intercostal catheter. (60% of marks) How does breathing 100% oxygen help in the resolution of a pneumothorax? (40% of marks)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2013
sitting: A
question: 14
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Describing the anatomy from skin to lungs, including the neurovascular bundle, was needed to pass this part of the question."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates described the technique for insertion of an intercostal catheter which was not requested."
- "Few identified the nerve supply to the area."
- "Most identified the “safe” triangle but failed to correctly identify its borders or draw a diagram to show anatomic landmarks."
- "Although most knew that 100% oxygen reduce the nitrogen content in a pneumothorax and this accelerates its adsorption, but did not go on to provide any quantification of partial pressure changes in blood and in the pneumothorax bubble."
