EC_errorsCommon:
- "Most candidates answered the question under the subheadings absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination. However, they didnâ€™t give any details of the direction or mechanism of change, often used vague statements without specifically addressing the question and failed to give examples."
- "The impact of the shock state on different kinetic parameters including absorption from skin, tissue, muscles, enteral absorption and inhalational was often overlooked."
- "Similarly, the consequences of changes in volume of distribution, protein binding (e.g. albumin and globulin, ionisation) was poorly understood as was alteration in liver and kidney function."
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Although this topic is very broad candidates were asked to only outline the details of this topic."
