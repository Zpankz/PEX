EC_extraCredit:
- "Gut function is regulated by the enteric nervous system and by paracrine and endocrine hormones released by hormone secreting cells in the mucosa of the gut (enteroendocrine cells). These cells secrete hormones in response to neural innervation or in response to triggers associated with ingested food. Gut functions influenced include secretion, digestion, absorption and motility."
