EC_errorsCommon:
- "Overall the first section was not answered in sufficient detail. Aspects such as the antidiuretic effects of vasopressin were often overlooked."
- "Some candidates spent more time on outlining the clinical contexts in which vasopressin is used (which did not score marks), rather than the physiology (which did score marks)."
- "DDAVP was the most common analogue mentioned, with the others often being omitted (e.g. terlipressin, ornipressin, etc.)."
