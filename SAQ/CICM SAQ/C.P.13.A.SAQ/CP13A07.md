title: "Describe how the respiratory system of a newborn differs from that of an adult."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2013
sitting: A
question: 07
EC_expectedDomains:
- "This question required anatomical detail relating to the upper airway and bronchial tree, which was generally answered well."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers mentioned the high physiological dead space, oxygen consumption and work of breathing."
- "Additional points were awarded for discussing the immaturity of the respiratory control centre and propensity for apnoea."
- "Better answers provided responses often in tabular format."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common omissions included not providing comparative adult data or a written description of how neonates differed from adults (or the significance of this)."
- "Candidates confused chest wall compliance (increased in newborns) with lung compliance (reduced in newborns but rapidly approaches normal adult values as “specific compliance”)."
- "Increased oxygen consumption necessitates increased minute ventilation (with tidal volumes equivalent to adults on a weight basis) via respiratory rate."
- "Functional Residual Capacity FRC (equivalent to adults) and Closing Capacity (increased relative to adults) were often confused."
- "Discussion of cardiovascular responses and response to drugs were not requested and gained no marks."
