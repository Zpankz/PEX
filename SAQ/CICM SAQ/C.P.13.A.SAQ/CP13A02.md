title: "Describe the physiology of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). (70% of marks) Describe the anatomy relevant to the performance of a lumbar puncture. (30% of marks)"
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2013
sitting: A
question: 02
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The physiology of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) required candidates to write about CSF formation, circulation and absorption, compare the composition of CSF to plasma and describe normal volumes and pressures. The functions of CSF also need to be listed."
- "The best approach to the anatomy of a lumbar puncture was to describe the lumbar intervertebral space at which the lumbar puncture is done and then describe the anatomical structures that the needle would traverse from the skin to the subarachnoid space."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Most candidates performed well in this question."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Some candidates described the displacement of CSF when intracranial pressure rises as a function of CSF. No marks were given for this."
- "Mentioning the indications for a lumbar puncture was not required."
