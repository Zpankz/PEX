title: "What is the Valsalva manoeuvre? Explain the cardiovascular response and include graphs in your answer."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2013
sitting: A
question: 03
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A good answer to this question required attention to detail and an ability to describe changes in many variables at each stage e.g. intrathoracic pressure, blood volumes, baroreceptor firing and the subsequent cardiovascular response (e.g. heart rate and blood pressure)."
- "Using graph(s) is a useful way to assist the explanation and was required as part of the answer."
- "Dividing the response into four stages makes answering the question much easier."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Using graph(s) is a useful way to assist the explanation and was required as part of the answer."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Overall there was a deficiency in a deep understanding of the integrated physiology associated with the Valsalva manoeuvre."
- "The most common mistakes were describing a change but not saying why it happened, not considering each element at each stage and confusing terms e.g. saying increased cardiac output when the response was increased mean arterial pressure."
- "Very few candidates drew accurate graphs. Graphs required were those of the changes in intrathoracic pressure, the pulse pressure response and the heart rate response."
