title: "List the different mechanisms of drug actions with examples."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2013
sitting: A
question: 01
EC_expectedDomains:
- "A good answer to this question required candidates to think broadly about how drugs act and have a system for classifying their actions. One possible classification is action via receptors or non-receptor actions."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Common problems were failure to mention a whole class of drug actions e.g. drugs acting via voltage-gated ion channels or gene transcription regulation."
- "Candidates also gave far too much detail in some sections e.g. a description of zero order and first order kinetics is not required."
- "Candidates often did not give examples of the drug action they described."
