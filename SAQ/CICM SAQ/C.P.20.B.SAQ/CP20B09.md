EC_expectedDomains:
- "Good candidates were able to outline the g/kg daily protein requirements and the distribution of remaining energy intake between carbohydrates and lipids and included how this may change during periods of stress."
- "They also stated the energy derived per gram of each of those food groups."
- "A definition of “vitamin” would have received credit."
- "Most candidates were able to classify vitamins as water soluble or fat soluble."
- "Most candidates mentioned trace elements (with an abbreviated list) and mentioned bone minerals."
- "A daily intake requirement for Na and K was expected, though not for bone minerals or trace elements."
EC_errorsCommon:

- "Similarly, with fat intake, few candidates mentioned the need for essential fatty acids."
EC_extraCredit:
- "This topic is well covered in the recommended physiology textbooks."
