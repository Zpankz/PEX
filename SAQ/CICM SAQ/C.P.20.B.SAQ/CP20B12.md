EC_expectedDomains:
- "The physiology discussion needed to include synthesis, factors affecting synthesis, distribution in the body (including the proportion divided between the plasma and interstitial space), functions, breakdown, and elimination half-life."
- "Discussion of the pharmacology should have included available preparations (4% and 20% Albumin) and pharmaceutics, distribution, elimination (both the protein and crystalloid components), mechanism of action to expand the plasma compartment, longevity in the plasma compartment, indications, and adverse effects."
- "Oedema, circulatory overload, immunological reactions, and relative contraindication in brain injury were important to mention."
- "An outline of the manufacturing process from donated plasma and pasteurisation was expected."
