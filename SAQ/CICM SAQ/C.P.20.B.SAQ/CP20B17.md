title: "Describe the pharmacology of inhaled nitric oxide (NO)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2020
sitting: B
question: 17
passRate: 24
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates generally did well in mentioning the impact on improving V/Q mismatch by promoting vasodilatation only in the ventilated alveoli and reducing RV afterload."
- "The expected adverse effects of NO were nitrogen dioxide related pulmonary toxicity, methemoglobinemia and rebound pulmonary hypertension on abrupt cessation."
- "It was expected that the answers would involve mention of location of delivery of NO in inspiratory limb and reason behind it, the high lipid solubility and diffusion, the dose (5-20ppm), very short half-life of < 5 seconds and combination with oxyhemoglobin to produce methaemoglobin and nitrate."
- "The main metabolite is nitrate which is excreted in urine."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates mentioned oxygen instead of nitrogen."
- "Many candidates did not mention the contraindications/caution for NO use."
- "Many candidates did not mention the extra cardio-respiratory effects."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Nitric Oxide (NO) is an inorganic colourless and odourless gas presented in cylinders containing 100/800 ppm of NO and nitrogen."
- "The exposure of NO to oxygen is minimized to reduce formation of nitrogen dioxide and free radicals."
- "Hence it is administered in inspiratory limb close to the endotracheal tube."
- "Pharmacokinetics of NO carried a significant proportion of marks."
