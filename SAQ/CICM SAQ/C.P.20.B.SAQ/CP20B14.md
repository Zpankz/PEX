EC_expectedDomains:
- "For this question, candidates were expected to address the location of the larynx, its relations, the cartilages (single and paired), ligaments, muscles (intrinsic and extrinsic), innervation (sensory and muscular) and blood supply (including venous drainage)."
- "Most candidates had a grasp of the gross anatomy, the main relations and at least the innervation provided by the recurrent laryngeal nerve."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "However, an understanding of the functional anatomy of the cartilages was not always apparent."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Marks were apportioned to each section, so whilst some detail was required, breadth of knowledge was also important."
- "It should be noted that not every single muscle needed to be named (especially for the extrinsic muscles), but an understanding of the major muscle groups should have been included."
