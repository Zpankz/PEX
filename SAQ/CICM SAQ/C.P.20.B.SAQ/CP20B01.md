title: "Describe and compare the action potentials from cardiac ventricular muscle cells and the sino-atrial node."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2020
sitting: B
question: 01
passRate: 72
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Comprehensive answers included both a detailed description of each action potential and a comparison highlighting and explaining any pertinent differences."
- "The question lends itself to well-drawn, appropriately labelled diagrams and further explanations expressed in a tabular form."
- "Better answers included a comparison table with points of comparison such as the relevant RMP, threshold value, overshoot value, duration, conduction velocity, automaticity, ion movements for each phase (including the direction of movement) providing a useful structure to the table."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Incorrect numbering of the phases (0 â€“ 4) and incorrect values for essential information (such as resting membrane potential) detracted from some responses."
EC_extraCredit:
- "This question details an aspect of cardiac physiology which is well described in multiple texts."
