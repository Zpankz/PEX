title: "Define afterload (10% marks) and describe the physiological factors that may affect afterload on the left ventricle (90% marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2020
sitting: B
question: 18
passRate: 53
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Most answers utilised the law of Laplace to expand upon factors affecting ventricular wall tension."
- "Systemic vascular resistance was commonly mentioned, but less frequently defined."
- "Aortic and left ventricular outflow tract impedance were commonly referred to."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Effects of preload and neurohumoral stimuli were less well outlined."
- "Description of factors affecting right ventricular afterload and depictions of left ventricular pressure volume loops earned no extra marks unless directly referenced to the question."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Afterload can be defined as factors resisting ventricular ejection and contributing to myocardial wall stress during systole."
