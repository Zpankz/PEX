entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2020
sitting: B
question: 07
passRate: 22
EC_expectedDomains:
- "To score well in this question, a statement of what could be measured (ICP: global vs local), a description of the measurement principles, along with other measurement related information like calibration and sources of error was required."
- "Also sought was information regarding anatomical placement (e.g., lateral ventricle for EVD) and method of placement."
- "Furthermore, a comparison with each other (e.g., higher infection/bleeding risk with EVD, greater risk of trauma due to size and insertion, expertise to insert, cost, therapeutic benefit, risk of blocking) was required for completion."
- "Candidates who structured these elements into advantages and disadvantages were generally able to elucidate this information and score better."
EC_extraCredit:
- "This question is ideally suited to a tabular format, where candidates are expected to highlight the significant similarities and differences as well as why a certain monitor may be chosen in preference to another rather than compile two lists written next to each other."
