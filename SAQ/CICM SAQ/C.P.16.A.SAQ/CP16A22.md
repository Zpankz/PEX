EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers could identify that vancomycin is slower at killing sensitive staph than flucloxacillin."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Marks were lost by not mentioning that flucloxacillin is a beta lactam that it does not cover MRSA and that vancomycin covers enterococcus."
- "Adverse effects were specifically asked for in the question so omitting facts such as associated nausea/vomiting/diarrhoea/anaphylaxis etc. cost some candidates marks."
- "If 25% of marks are allocated to side effects then it is expected more than one adverse effect would be mentioned."
- "Some candidates had incorrect facts Enterococcus is not a gram negative organism."
