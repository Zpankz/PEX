EC_expectedDomains:
- "A good answer included a definition of temperature and a classification of the methods of measuring temperature such as electrical, non-electrical and infrared."
- "There followed a brief description of the physical principles of thermistors, thermocouples and resistance thermometers; mercury and alcohol thermometers, bimetallic strips; and of infrared methods."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Candidates who did well reproduced the content of the chapter on temperature measurement in the recommended text book."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates who were not familiar with this material attempted to answer the question by falling back on clinical experience of measuring temperature in different sites or occasionally referring to concepts of thermoregulation."
- "Neither approach gained credit."
- "Some candidates interpreted “methods” incorrectly as 'site of measurement' so scored poorly."
