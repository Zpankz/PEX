- "It was expected candidates could detail the major changes such as a 40 – 50% increase in blood volume, a 30 – 50% increase in cardiac output, a slight decrease in blood pressure, the heart size and position changes, the impact of aortocaval compression and alterations in colloid osmotic pressure."
- "Some mention of the changes during labour and delivery was expected noting uterine contraction squeezes blood to maternal circulation (auto transfusion), cardiac output increases (immediately after delivery up by about 60 – 80%) and blood pressure increases (both systolic and diastolic) during labour."
