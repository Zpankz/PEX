title: "Outline the anatomy of the subclavian vein relevant to central venous line insertion."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2016
sitting: A
question: 16
passRate: 38
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected candidates could detail course (from origin to end) and relations of subclavian vein."
- "This could then be used to highlight how these features may be relevant to central venous line insertion (proximity of subclavian artery or pleura creating the possibility of inadverant arterial puncture or pneumothorax."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates failed to mention drainage of external jugular vein and thoracic duct and right lymphatic ducts into the subclavian veins."
- "Care should be taken ensuring accuracy (e.g. some mentioned dome of diaphragm instead of pleura or IVC instead of SVC)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Answers to anatomy questions can be generally structured by considered the origin and ending of the structure, the surface landmarks and the relations (medial / lateral / anterior / posterior) and this would have worked well in this question."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates should ensure diagrams are accurate and well labelled and they use appropriate anatomical terminology rather than vague terms such as “in front”."
