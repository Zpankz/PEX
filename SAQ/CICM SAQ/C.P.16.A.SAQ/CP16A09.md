title: "Describe the essential components of an ECG monitor (80% of marks). Outline the methods employed to reduce artefact (20% of marks)."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2016
sitting: A
question: 09
passRate: 50
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The amplifier has three essential functions: High input impedance so as to minimize signal loss and reject interference (50 â€“ 60 Hz), differential amplification, (to amplify the potential difference detected by the skin electrodes), and high common mode rejection (e.g. > 50Hz) to aid eliminating muscle artefact or electrical interference from the power grid.)."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Better answers made mention of the two lead types: unipolar and bipolar."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Vector analysis is not a component of the ECG machine and so was not required to answer the question."
