EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected candidates could detail the impact of PEEP on a variety of respiratory parameters such as lung volume, dead space, arterial pO2 and intrapleural pressure."
- "The cardiovascular consequences are well described including the effect on cardiac output, blood pressure and oxygen delivery."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "The physiological impact of lower levels PEEP in a young healthy person is different to that often seen in the critically ill and this was not appreciated by most candidates."
