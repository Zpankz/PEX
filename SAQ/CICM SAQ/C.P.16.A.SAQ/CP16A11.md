- "Most successful answers used an organ systems approach to include the many side effects of amiodarone."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates provided irrelevant and lengthy descriptions of the mechanisms of action of amiodarone which was not asked for in the question and gained no additional marks."
- "Many candidates failed to mention skin side effects, neurological side effects, GI/hepatic side effects, pregnancy and breast feeding considerations, and interactions with other highly protein bound drugs."
- "The predominant mechanism for hypotension with rapid IV administration of amiodarone was incorrectly given in a number of answers."
