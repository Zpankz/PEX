title: "In relation to neuromuscular blocking drugs â€“ Discuss the factors that influence the speed of ONSET of neuromuscular block."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2016
sitting: A
question: 12
passRate: 38
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected candidates would address the main factors known to influence the speed of onset of neuromuscular block: potency of the agent used (inverse relationship to speed of onset); rate of delivery of the agent to the NMJ (blood flow / muscle group); and mechanism of the neuromuscular block (nondepolarising vs depolarising)."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "This information is different to the factors that influence neuromuscular blockade in general which was what many candidates focussed on."
