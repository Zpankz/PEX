title: "Outline the determinants of oxygen delivery to the tissues."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2016
sitting: A
question: 01
passRate: 61
EC_expectedDomains:
- "It was expected that candidates would provide a description of the determinants of both oxygen content and cardiac output."
- "Determinant of cardiac output completed the answer, often starting with CO = HR x SV while discussing the importance of preload, afterload and contractility."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Many candidates spent little time on cardiac output which cost valuable marks."
- "Some candidates provided a lot of detail on how oxygen is managed within the lung, the majority of which was not required as part of the answer."
- "Some candidates answered the question describing the oxygen cascade only which was not sufficient to score well."
EC_extraCredit:
- "An opening statement such as oxygen delivery = cardiac output x oxygen content then allowed a more detailed description of the determinants of both oxygen content and cardiac output."
