EC_expectedDomains:
- "Candidates were required to discuss the pharmacology relevant to treating OGP poisoning, including active decontamination/staff protection due to high lipid solubility, use of antimuscarinics with central and peripheral action to treat cholinergic symptoms, supportive therapy for muscle weakness (there is no antinicotinic agent available which does not exacerbate muscle weakness), and finally the use of the cholinesterase regenerator, Pralidoxime, which may prevent the OGP-AChE complex ageing and becoming an irreversible bond if given in a timely fashion."
