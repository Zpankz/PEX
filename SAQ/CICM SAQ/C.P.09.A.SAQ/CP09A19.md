- "These included the hormones gastrin and somatostatin, the enzymes pepsin, lipase and gelatinase, the electrolytes Na+, K+ and HCO3, HCl and water, prostaglandins and mucus, and intrinsic factor."
- "For example: HCl secreted by parietal cells to produce a very acidic environment pH 1-3.5. This optimizes proteolytic activity of pepsin, has a direct proteolytic role, aids ferric iron conversion to the more soluble ferrous ion, and is important for bactericidal activity and innate immunity. It also stimulates pancreatic and biliary secretions."
