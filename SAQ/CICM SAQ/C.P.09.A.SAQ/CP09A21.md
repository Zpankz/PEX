- "[[G2f2d]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The antidepressant action is similar for each agent."
- "Initial increase in 5HT and NA, followed in 2-3 weeks by a down regulation or change in efficiency of 5HT transmission."
- "The agents produce elevated neurotransmitters via different mechanisms, either reuptake blockade or enzyme inhibition."
- "MAOIs can be competitive or non-competitive."
- "Mention of the different neurotransmitters affected by each agent was required."
- "A description of significant side effects at therapeutic doses, and in overdose was expected with explanations provided."
- "These should have included - the anticholinergic effects and cardiotoxicity of TCAs, postural hypotension, the catecholamine, pethidine and tyramine related complications of MAOIs, and serotonin syndrome with SSRI/MAOI use and or overdose."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Good answers were in tabular format."
- "More marks were gained for mention that side effect profiles can be beneficial e.g. analgesic properties of TCAs, sedation with TCAs/ SSRIs and energizing benefits of SSRIs/SNRIs."
- "SSRI’s safety and efficacy have markedly reduced the use of MAOIs and to a lesser extent TCA’s.."
