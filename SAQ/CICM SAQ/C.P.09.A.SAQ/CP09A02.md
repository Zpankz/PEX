college: CICM
year: 2009
sitting: A
question: 02
passRate: 10
lo:
- "[[B1h]]"
- "[[2e]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The main points for a pass include a brief description of the citric acid cycle and a list of facts such as storage of CO2 (120L), production (200ml/min) and that 2 molecules of CO2 are produced for 1 molecule ATP."
- "A statement that PaCO2 is proportional to CO2 production/alveolar ventilation would help answer the second part."
EC_extraCredit:
- "An example of increased CO2 production is fever, and of decreased alveolar ventilation is increased anatomical dead space."
