title: "Relate the surface ECG to the events of the cardiac cycle (60% of mark). Describe how the PR, QRS and QT intervals may be prolonged by the action of drugs."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2009
sitting: A
question: 01
passRate: 50
lo:
- "[[Cib2c]]"
- "[[C2c2b]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The first part of the question is best answered by a labelled and annotated diagram of the ECG with the pressure events of the cardiac cycle."
- "The second part of the question could be answered in a tabular format such as: Interval PR QRS QT Drug Digoxin Tricyclic antidepressants SSRI’s Mechanism Increases refractory period of AV node probably by increased vagal activity Quinidine like effect, decreasing sodium influx into cells Malfunction of calcium ion channels"
EC_extraCredit: []
EC_errorsCommon:
