title: "Explain the causes of the difference between measured end tidal and arterial partial pressures of carbon dioxide."
entityType: SAQ
exam: PEX
college: CICM
year: 2009
sitting: A
question: 09
passRate: 10
lo:
- "[[S2g]]"
- "[[B1g2]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "Points required to pass this question included the normal difference between end-tidal and arterial partial pressure of C02 and the reasons for this."
- "The patient factors that increase the difference include increases in alveolar dead space and a slow rise of expired C02."
- "Equipment factors needed to be included e.g. leaks, occlusion of sampling line."
EC_extraCredit:
- "Mention of pathology e.g. pulmonary embolism and cardiac arrest gained extra marks."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "Candidates who failed did not discuss alveolar dead space and very few adequately explained how it increased the end tidal to arterial partial pressure difference."
