college: CICM
year: 2009
sitting: A
question: 13
passRate: 30
lo:
- "[[D2b]]"
EC_expectedDomains:
- "The volume and composition of the glomerular filtrate are best explained by referring to the equation: Glomerular Filtration = Kf x net filtration pressure."
- "Then describing the factors that affect each part of the equation e.g. hydrostatic pressure, oncotic pressure, factors that influence the filtration coefficient e.g. surface area Glomerular filtrate is an ultrafiltrate of plasma and factors that affect the passage of proteins and other molecules should be discussed"
EC_extraCredit:
- "Extra marks were given for an explanation of filtration fraction and short facts about GFR in paediatric patients and the elderly."
EC_errorsCommon:
- "No marks were given for any discussion of drugs."
