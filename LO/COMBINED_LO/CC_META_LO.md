# Cardiac Output

Cardiac output is a crucial hemodynamic parameter. Its determinants are classically divided into:

- [[Heart Rate]]
- [[Stroke Volume]]

## [[Heart Rate]]

[[Heart Rate]] can be further subdivided into:

- [[Automaticity]]
- [[Conduction]]
- [[Electromechanical Capture]]

[[Heart Rate]] is mediated by the [[Sympathetic Nervous System]].

[[Heart Rate]] is also mediated by [[Venus Return]] through the [[Bowditch-Treppe Effect]].

## [[Stroke Volume]]

[[Stroke Volume]] is further subdivided into:

- [[Preload]]
- [[Afterload]]
- [[Contractility]]

### [[Preload]]

[[Preload]] mediates [[Stroke Volume]] through the [[Frank-Starling Mechanism]], which describes [[Stretch-fibre Coupling]].

[[Preload]] is mediated by [[Venus Return]] and [[Diastolic Filling]].

[[Diastolic Filling]] mediates [[Preload]] based on [[Diastolic Function]].

### [[Afterload]]

[[Afterload]] mediates [[Contractility]] through the [[Anrep Effect]].

[[Afterload]] heavily influences [[Coronary Perfusion Pressure]] (CPP) downstream, via both [[Transmural Intra-ventricular Pressure]] and [[Diastolic Aortic Impedance]].

### [[Contractility]]

[[Contractility]] is mediated by the [[Sympathetic Nervous System]].

[[Contractility]] is a key determinant of upstream [[Mean Arterial Pressure]].

[[Contractility]] is heavily influenced by [[Coronary Perfusion Pressure]] (CPP). However, hyperdynamic [[Contractility]] can become its own [[Starling Resistor]].

## Determinants of [[Venus Return]]

[[Venus Return]] is determined by:

- [[Mean Systemic Filling Pressure]]
- [[Stressed Blood Volume]]
- [[Respiratory Variation]]

## Determinants of [[Diastolic Filling]]

[[Diastolic Filling]] is augmented by:

- [[Pericardial Stiffness]]
- [[Intraventricular Dependence]]
- the ratio and magnitude of [[Intrathoracic Pressure]] and [[Intra-abdominal Pressure]]

## [[Coronary Perfusion Pressure]] (CPP)

[[Coronary Perfusion Pressure]] (CPP) is a key determinant of [[Contractility]].

[[Coronary Perfusion Pressure]] (CPP) is heavily influenced by [[Afterload]] downstream.

[[Coronary Perfusion Pressure]] (CPP) is also an important determinant due to [[DO2]] because a high [[Extraction Ratio]] means that changes in delivery are critical.  [[Hyperoxia]] is known to cause deleterious [[Coronary Vasoconstriction]] and reduce [[Coronary Perfusion Pressure]] (CPP).

[[Diastolic Filling Time]], especially in the context of [[Tachyarrhythmia]], can further impair [[Diastolic Filling]] dependant [[Left Ventricular Coronary Perfusion]].
