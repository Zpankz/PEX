[[Single Compartment Model]] vs [[Multi-compartment model]]

Can these models be compared at this level?

| Parameter              | Single Compartment | Multi-Compartment |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Half-Life              |                    |                   |
| Clearance              |                    |                   |
| First Order            |                    |                   |
| Zero Order             |                    |                   |
| Volume of Distribution |                    |                   |
| Bioavailability        |                    |                   |
| AUC Plasma             |                    |                   |
| Extraction Ratio       |                    |                   |
