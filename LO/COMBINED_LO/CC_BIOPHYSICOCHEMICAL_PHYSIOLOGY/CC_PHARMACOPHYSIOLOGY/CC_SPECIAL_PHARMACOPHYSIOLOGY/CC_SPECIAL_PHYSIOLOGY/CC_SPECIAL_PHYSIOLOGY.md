CICM - 

- "For all sections of the syllabus an understanding of normal physiology and physiology at extremes of age, obesity, pregnancy (including foetal) and disease (particularly critical illness) is expected. 
- Similarly, for pharmacology, trainees are expected to understand a drug's pharmacology in these contexts."
