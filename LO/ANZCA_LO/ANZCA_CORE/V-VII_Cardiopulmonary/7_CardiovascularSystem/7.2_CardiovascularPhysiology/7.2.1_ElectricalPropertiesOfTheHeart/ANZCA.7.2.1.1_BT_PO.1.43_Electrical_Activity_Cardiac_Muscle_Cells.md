[[Describe]] the [[physiological basis of electrical activity]] and its [[relationship]] to [[mechanical events]] including the:

* [[Ionic basis of automaticity]]
* The [[normal processes of cardiac excitation|normal]] and [[abnormal processes of cardiac excitation]]
* [[Physiological basis]] of the [[electrocardiogram]] in [[normal]] and [[common pathological states]]
* [[Factors]] that may [[influence cardiac electrical activity]]
* Correlation of the [[mechanical events of the cardiac cycle]] with the [[electrical events of the cardiac cycle|electrical]] and [[ionic events of the cardiac cycle|ionic events]]
