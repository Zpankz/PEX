[^1]:20A - 24B ER Summary
	- The CICM First Part Examination explores the knowledge of the basic medical sciences that form the foundation of intensive care practice. 
	- A detailed syllabus has been developed and clearly sets out the level of understanding expected for each listed topic and drug. It is important that candidates study the syllabus in its entirety. 
	- All questions are sourced from the syllabus and the recommended texts are a guide to the level of information required. Some sections of the syllabus require more extensive research and the use of other textbooks. 
	- **Candidates are expected to attain a level of knowledge that goes beyond just the listing of pure facts but should be able to explain, describe, collate, and apply that knowledge across different circumstances relevant to intensive care practice.**
	- Sufficient depth of understanding and a structured approach to providing answers continues to remain an area of weakness for many candidates.
[^2]: T-17 Notes to Candidates for the First Part Examination
	- The First Part Examination endeavours to examine the syllabus across Bloom's Taxonomy of Cognitive Domains or Taxonomy of Education Objectives. 
	- Due to the nature of the syllabus the exam will generally focus on the Remember (Knowledge), Understand, Apply and Analyse domains. 
	- **Remember** – recall facts and basic concepts – define, list, recall and state. 
	- **Understand** – explain ideas or concepts – classify, describe, discuss and explain. 
	- **Apply** – use information in new situations and draw connections among ideas – use, demonstrate and interpret.
	- **Analyse** _-_ draw connections among ideas - implement, compare, contrast, differentiate and relate.
	- The written exam will require you to demonstrate knowledge recall and understanding with less requirement for application of this knowledge. The oral component will examine the application and analyse domains of Blooms Taxonomy.
